## Press Contacting Guide
Before contacting any member of the press or any reviewer, be sure to look over [this link](http://buysomeindiegames.com/how-to-sell-your-game/how-to-write-a-press-release/) to get an idea of the basic necessities of all such contacts.

When possible, it is best to see if a reviewer website has an individual who specializes in visual novels, as they would be the best people to contact. Be sure that if you do contact an individual that you make the email somewhat personal (not too personal though), so be sure to use the person's name in the email.

In terms of explaining Ganbatte you should take a look at [this article](http://www.pentadact.com/2012-03-17-gdc-talk-how-to-explain-your-game-to-an-asshole/) to get an idea of how to best go about explaining it.

Be sure to refer the contact to the press kit for [Infinite Dango Studios](https://infinite-dango-studios.github.io/press_kit/) and [Ganbatte](https://infinite-dango-studios.github.io/press_kit/ganbatte/), as they are important resources that the contacts will likely find very helpful if they do decide to write about the game.

Feel free to tell the contact a bit about who you are and the work you personally contributed to the project, but this shouldn't take up the majority of the email.

Once you have started contacting an individual or website, please let the rest of us know so that we don't accidentally contact them as well. Once we get more into the advertising process we will likely set up a system to keep track of who is contacting who.

## Social Media
Using social media is an important part of advertising. Currently Ganbatte is being advertised through social media with Facebook, however we will probably need to branch out to other social media sites like Twitter and Reddit over time.
