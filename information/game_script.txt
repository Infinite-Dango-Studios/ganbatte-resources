(Dark screen with text)
I’ll never forget that summer. 
(some sort of pensive music plays IDK)
The summer that I spent in Maura. The summer that I met her. That summer, when I met all of them. So many regrets, but also so many things I don’t regret…so many things that I wouldn’t trade for the world. The people I met, the things I experienced…it all started when I went to live with Kosuke Kasai, my friend from grade school, and his twin sister, Misaki. I needed a change of pace before moving on to college and the next stage of my life, and they were happy to provide it.

(Scene lights up on entrance to Maura, a grassy field and stone path. It is sunny.)
It was sunny the day that I arrived, and the sun felt warm on my face. As the warm summer breeze enveloped me, I could already tell that this trip would be exactly what I need. They were waiting for me, looking just as I remembered them, only a little older. 
(Kosuke and Misaki Kasai appear. They are standing in front of the scene)
Kosuke Kasai
(happy music)
(Happy expression, normal clothes)
“HI HARUKI-KUN~! HOW ARE YOU? I HAVEN’T SEEN YOU IN AGES! You still look as handsome as ever, though, wouldn’t you say so, Misaki-chan?”

Misaki Kasai
(blush, normal clothes)
“Why would you ask me that!?!”

Kosuke
(happy or smirk. Normal clothes)
“I DON’T KNOW, MAYBE ALL OF THOSE DIARY--!”

Misaki 
(angry. Normal Clothes (N.C.))
“SHUT UP! THERE ARE NO DIARY ENTRIES.”

She seems pretty upset by her brother’s accusation, so maybe it’s a little more accurate than she wants to admit.  

Kosuke
(happy. N.C.)
(SFX laugh if possible)
“She’s TOTALLY in love with you, Haruki-kun. What do you say, will you marry my darling sister?”

Haruki (player)
1.	W-where’s this coming from?
2.	NO! NEVER! WHY WOULD YOU EVEN…?
3.	T-this is all very sudden…but…I’d be willing to try…
OPTION 1 (points to Kosuke and Misaki)
Kosuke
(laugh. N.C.)
“Geez, you’re turning pretty red!”

I feel a blush beginning to burn on my cheeks, and I know that he is telling the truth. 

Haruki
“W-well, I, um, I mean!”

Kosuke
“Wow, you’re really flustered…You’re worse than me with girls!”

Misaki
“Says the man who almost wet himself the last time he talked to a cute girl. My brother the charming lady’s man!”

Misaki’s laughing now, but Kosuke looks like he wants to evaporate like a water droplet on hot pavement. 

Haruki
“You still do that?” 

Kosuke
(blush)
“N-no!”

Misaki
(smirk)
“Yes he does~! I have to take all the female customers at the café.”

Option 2 (no points or negative points to Misaki)
Misaki
(angry)
“NO? NEVER? WHAT THE HELL!?!”

Haruki
“N-no…! I didn’t mean it like that, I meant…”

(SFX “SLAP!”)

Misaki
“That was really rude, Haruki-kun.” 

Kosuke
“Wow sis, you’re pretty offended….”

Haruki
“I’m so sorry!”

I bow, although she still seems upset. 

Misaki
“Whatever.”

Option 3 (Misaki points)
Kosuke
(shocked)
“WHAT!?!!”

Misaki
(blush)
“I-IDIOT!” 
(narrative) And then, she said quieter
“Did you really mean it?”

Haruki
“Well, I, uh, I mean…”

I fumble for words, unsure what I should say. Luckily, Kosuke intervenes. 

Kosuke
(awkward)
“It was a joke! But I guess it wasn’t very funny…”

ALL THE TIMELINES MERGE AGAIN

(narrative) A long moment of silence fell between the three of us before Kosuke speaks up again.


Kosuke
“Annnnnnnyways~!
So, Haurki-kun, you haven’t found anywhere to stay yet, have you?”

I look down at my feet, it’s true, I haven’t. And without a job, I can’t even afford to rent a place for myself. I sigh and remain silent.

Misaki
“Maybe you should stay with us, Haruki-kun~!” 

Haruki
“Stay with you?”

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Wow sis, that’s pretty bold. He might see all the pictures you ha—“

Misaki
(blush)
“THERE ARE NO PICTURES! 
DON’T LISTEN TO HIM HARUKI-KUN, HE’S JUST KIDDING. ONLY AN IDIOT WOULD BELIEVE HIM.” 

She seems pretty flustered. I wonder what pictures she has. Are they of me? 


Kosuke
“Geez, I’m just kidding, sis. 
Anyway, want to stay with us?”

I don’t really have a choice.

Haruki
“Sure, that would be nice.”

It would be. It will be more fun living with them than on my own. And, now I’m curious about all of Misaki’s diary entries and pictures. This is going to be fun.

Kosuke
“Awesome! This is great! We have a spare room, so you can probably stay there, if my parents say it’s ok.” 

Then, an odd smirk crossed his face.

Kosuke
“Or, you could stay in Misaki’s room!”

Misaki
(angry, blushing, upset)
“STOP STAYING THINGS LIKE THAT, KOSUKE-KUN!” 

They’re just as weird as I remember them. 

Kosuke
(awkward)
“Geez, sis, just kidding. Anyways, our house isn’t far from here. Just follow us Haruki-kun! We’ll be your guide to Maura and all its secrets!”

Haruki
“Secrets?”

He says nothing in response, but merely smirks and gestures for me to join him and Misaki as they walk up the road into Maura.
(Kosuke and Misaki are no longer on screen)
I wonder what secrets he could be talking about. As far as I know, this is just a quiet place to raise a family. I suppose it has its fair share of interesting people, what place doesn’t? But secrets? That I doubt. 
Kosuke and Misaki are all the way up the hill now, and they’ve turned back to look at me. I had better follow them. I smile slightly and I walk with the breeze at my back, this summer is already turning out better than expected.
(Scene shift to ext. Kasai house.)
Kosuke and Misaki live in a cluster of houses a short walk from Maura’s main commercial center. I suppose that would be a good place to find a job, but I can think more about that later. The Kasai house is decently sized for a place such as this, with two floors and green shingles on the roof. A small sign reading “Kasai” sits at the end of a small stone path leading to a bright green door. Kosuke and Misaki are already standing on the porch and gesture for me to join them. 
(int. Kasai house)
(Kosuke and Misaki are on screen)
They slip on their house slippers, and I slip off my shoes.
Kosuke
“There are some guest slippers, you can wear those!”

Haruki
“Thank you!”

Misaki
“MOM~! DAD~! WE’RE HOME~!”

(M. Kasai and Ms. Kasai replace Kosuke and Misaki)

Ms. Kasai
(happy)
“Oh, Haruchan, is that you? You’ve grown up so much since the last time we saw you!”

Mr. Kasai
“Well, it has been several years since we last saw him, honey!” 

Ms. Kasai
“It has been a while, hasn’t it? How is your mother?”

I think back to all the times Ms. Kasai brought Kosuke and Misaki to my house to play when we were younger. She must be just as good friends with my mother as I am with Kosuke. 
Haruki
“She’s good!”

It’s a simplistic answer, but I don’t particularly feel like going into detail. It’s not like anything major has happened. No death or mysterious illness. Nothing out of the ordinary. Almost like the past couple of years did not even happen. 

Ms. Kasai
“That’s good to hear! You’re staying in Maura for the summer, right?”

I open my mouth to answer, but Kosuke cuts me off before I can even get out a syllable. 
(Kosuke and Ms. Kasai are on screen)

Kosuke
“Yeah, he is! But he doesn’t have anywhere to stay, so can he stay here?”

Ms. Kasai
(smiling)
“I don’t see why not! We’d love to host you, Haruchan!”

I feel relieved. I don’t think I realized until now how stressed out I was about not finding a place to stay. 

(Mr. Kasai and Misaki take over the screen)


Mr. Kasai
“I was just about to start making dinner, you should probably unpack until it’s ready.”

Misaki
(excited)
“OOH, DAD! I WANT TO MAKE DINNER FOR HARUKI-KUN!”

Mr. Kasai
(horrified)
“ABSOLUTELY NOT! YOU ALMOST BURNED THE HOUSE DOWN LAST TIME!”

Misaki
(upset)
“But I’ve been practicing since then! Just ask mom!”

Mr. Kasai
“Fine, you can help.”

Misaki
(excited)
“Yay! It’s going to taste really good, Haruki-kun, I promise!”

And then she muttered something to herself that I couldn’t quite make out. I’m fairly certain that I heard the word “wife”. Oh well, I must have been just hearing things. A moment later, Misaki and Mr. Kasai disappear into the kitchen.

(Kosuke and Ms. Kasai retake the screen)

Ms. Kasai
“Kosuchan, can you help Haruchan unpack?”

Kosuke
(happy/excited)
“Sure! Right this way, Haruki-kun!”

(Ms. Kasai and Kosuke disappear)

Kosuke leads me down the hallway, and we enter the second room to the left. 

(Scene switches to Haruki’s room)

It is a small room, decorated comfortably but not particularly uniquely. There is a single window with flowered drapes, and the orangey light of the incoming sunset was seeping through it. A small wooden bookshelf sits in the corner to the left of the door, and a simple dark-wooden desk sits next to it. The bed sits beside the window, simple and twin-size, covered by pale blue sheets. A nightstand sits beside the bed, and like the bookshelf and desk it is empty. It is a plain room, and yet I cannot help but feel at home in it. Once I unpack everything, it will probably feel just like home. 

I place my bags on the bed and open them. Kosuke silently helps me unpack my clothes. They end up filling around half the closet, I do not really enjoy shopping for clothes. My clothes unpacked, we move on to my second bag, which is filled with various personal effects. I decide to fill the bookshelves first. 

(Kosuke appears on screen)

Kosuke
(excited)
“WHOA, NO WAY! YOU READ THIS TOO?”

He is holding my copy of Tokyo Ghoul volume one. I only really started the series a month ago, and I have not had much time to read it, but I enjoy it. 

Haruki
“Yeah! I’m only almost through it, and it’s been good so far.”

I arrange my copies of Tokyo Ghoul on the bookshelf and I unload various other manga and light novels. 

Kosuke
“Hey, can I borrow these?”

He is holding my stack of No. 6. I’ve already read all of them, so I don’t see the harm. 


Haruki
“Sure, you’re living just upstairs, so I can find you if you try to steal them from me.”

Kosuke
(innocent?)
“You know I wouldn’t do that!”

Once we are finished stocking the bookshelf, I place my journal and handheld gaming device on the desk. My bags are empty now, so I place them in the closet. 

Haruki
“Do you suppose dinner is ready yet?”

Kosuke
“Probably not. We didn’t take very long to unpack…Want to go to my room to play some video games while we wait?”

Haruki
“Sure!”

(Time passing sequence? I don’t think we need the gaming scene. Shifts to dinner scene. Can just re-use the Int. Kasai House backdrop. Misaki is on screen)


Misaki 
“Dinner time, Haruki-kun~!!!!” 

When Kosuke and I arrived in the dining room, the table had been set with plates of Chirashizushi, Tempura and Dango. All of my favorites. I guess Misaki must have remembered, we did eat a lot together as children. 

Misaki
 “Do you like it, Haruki-kun? I made it special for you!”

Haruki
“Yeah, it’s all my favorites! Thank you.” 

Kosuke
(appears on screen)
“Um, hey sis, I’m here too.”

Misaki
(annoyed)
“HARUKI-KUN IS THE GUEST!” 

Kosuke
(smug)
“Well, you may have made him dinner, but I played video games with him and he let me borrow all his copies of No. 6.” 

Misaki
(annoyed)
“Really? Well maybe I have some books that he wants. Hey Haruki-kun, want to come to my room after dinner and check out my light novels and manga? I have, um, Spice and Wolf, and Black Bullet and Durarara!! and—“ 

Kosuke
(angry)
“HEY! HARUKI-KUN PROMISED TO PLAY MORE SMASH BROS AFTER DINNER WITH ME!”

They’re practically screaming at each other now, and I feel a blush burn on my cheeks.

Misaki
(angry)
“YOU’VE HAD HIM THE ENTIRE TIME HE’S BEEN HERE!”

Kosuke
(angry)
“YOU DO REALIZE THAT IT’S ONLY BEEN, LIKE, AN HOUR, RIGHT? AND BESIDES, HE’S MY BEST FRIEND!” 

I smile awkwardly. Are they fighting over me? Living here is certainly going to be interesting. 


Haruki
“Um….I’m kinda hungry, maybe we can just have dinner? I can decide what I want to do later.” 

They seem to remember that I’m there, and they both blush. 

Kosuke
(blush)
“Oh, haha, sorry, Haruki-kun, I sort of forgot that you were there for a minute.”

Misaki
(blush)
“Sorry that my brother’s such an idiot, Haruki-kun!”

I’m not really sure how to respond to the two of them so I just laugh and we all sit down at the table. For a few minutes, the only noises are the cacophony of noises which typically accompany eating. Both Kosuke and Misaki are eating quietly and won’t make eye contact to me. I suppose that they’re guilty about fighting over me. Finally, Mr. Kasai speaks up.

(Mr. and Mrs. Kasai are on screen)

Mr. Kasai
“So, Haruchan, what are your plans for this summer?”

I sit silently for a few moments, taking another bite of Chirashizushi. I realize now just how poorly planned this trip is. I guess I just decided to come to Maura to see Kosuke and Misaki. But now the question’s been asked and he’s waiting for a response. If I don’t speak up now, he could kick me out! It could ruin the entire trip. Possibly. 

Haruki
“Um….I guess I want to meet some interesting people? And I should probably get a job.” 

Ms. Kasai
“Do you have any ideas for employment?”

I think it over for a moment before shaking my head. I don’t really know who’s hiring in Maura at the moment. 

(Kosuke and Misaki on screen replacing the parents)

Misaki
“YOU SHOULD COME WORK AT THE CAFÉ!”

She practically jumps out of her seat as she says it. These guys sure are eager to spend time with me.

Haruki
“What café?”




Kosuke
(confused)
“I never told you, Haruki-kun? Misaki and I work at a little café in town. The coworkers are all pretty great. You’ll love Kokona-chan, she’s super sweet. The customers are all really interesting too. Plus, our boss, Riku-san is totally cool. He’ll probably hire you without too much convincing.”  

Haruki
“Ehh, I don’t know…”

It sounds like a good job, to be honest. It sounds like I’ll meet some interesting people, and I’ll be able to get the job without much of a struggle. That’s always a bonus. And yet, at the same time, I’ve never really pictured myself working at a café. It doesn’t really seem like my sort of thing. 

Kosuke
(upset?)
“Aww, C’mon! It could be a lot of fun…”

Misaki
(smirk)
“Plus you’ll get to see me in my cute uniform~! Every day! What else could you possibly want?”

I feel a deep blush erupt on my cheeks, and I try not to look Misaki directly in the eye. I see Mr. and Ms. Kasai looking back and forth between me and Misaki, and I can tell that they are reconsidering allowing us to sleep in the same house. 

Haruki
“Haha, well…when you put it like that!”

Kosuke
(beaming)
“GREAT! Misaki and I have work tomorrow, so I can introduce you to Riku-san then!” 

I nod my agreement, it sounds good. In truth, I was hoping for a little time to relax before getting too busy, but this job sounds fun at least. 

Dinner is over not long after that, and both Kosuke and Misaki look at me expectantly after all the dishes have been cleared. It suddenly dawns on me that I can’t put off the decision any longer. I’ll have to either go to Misaki’s room or to Kosuke’s. But which one should I choose?

Kosuke
“So, Haruki-kun, what’s happening now?”

Misaki
“Yeah, Haruki-kun, did you decide where you want to go?”

Haruki
1.	“I think it would be fun to hang out with you, Misaki-chan!”
2.	“I think I’d like to play more video games with Kosuke-kun!”
3.	“Actually, I’m kinda tired. And tomorrow’s going to be busy. I’m just going to go to bed.”

OPTION 1 –MISAKI (Misaki points)
Kosuke
(disappointed)
“Oh….OK, Haruki-kun. Uh…have fun.”

Misaki
(excited)
“YAY! YOU MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE, HARUKI-KUN! THIS’LL BE REALLY FUN!”

Haruki
“Oh…haha, you seem pretty excited…”

Misaki
(still excited)
“I AM! RIGHT THIS WAY, HARUKI-KUN!”

Misaki grabs my wrist and pulls me away from the dining room at a run. I’m happy to be spending this time with her, but she practically drags me across the carpet as we tear through the halls. She pulls me up the stairs, and we enter the first room on the left. 
(Scene switch to Misaki’s room. No one on screen)
Her room is nice, if a little messy. It’s a lot like my room, although more personalized. Her bed is covered in bright purple sheets, and a little stuffed turtle sits atop them. Pictures cover her walls, mostly of her, Kosuke and her parents. A few pictures depict me and Misaki and a few others are just me. In truth, I do not remember when a few of them were taken, and I am not looking at the camera in them. On her desk sits a little pink book that I assume is the infamous diary, and I cautiously walk over to it. A loose paper is sticking out and I glance at it. It’s a sketch in pencil of a man. Upon further inspection, he is completely naked with the exception of a single, strategically placed heart. My eyes widen as I recognize the face…I’m fairly certain that it’s mine. 

Haruki
“Uh…you…uh…drew this?”

I’ve never seen a face go so red so quickly. 
(Misaki is now on screen)

Misaki
(blushing)
“N-NO! I-I MEAN, THAT’S NOTHING! ER, I MEAN…DON’T LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE’S PERSONAL STUFF, IDIOT! ER…UH…HEY, LOOK MY BOOKSHELF, UH, LET’S LOOK AT BOOKS!”

Her face is the deepest shade of scarlet I have ever seen as she quickly pushes the sketch back into the depths of the notebook. I feel myself blushing a little too, this is kind of awkward. 

Misaki
“So…Haruki-kun, um, what kind of books do you like?”

Haruki
“Um, a lot of things…most recently I’ve been reading Tokyo Ghoul.”


Misaki
(excited)
“Ooh, I have all of that, do you need the next book?” 

Haruki
“No, I’m on book 13 and I already have the 14th.” 

Misaki
(normal)
“Oh, ok. Have you read Ouran High School Host Club? Elfen Lied? Watamote?”
She pulls the first book in each of these series’ out as she says their names. And then, she gets a devious grin.
(evil smile)
“Or maybe, you’re more into this, Haruki-kun?”
She pulls out two more books.
“Want to borrow my Sakura Trick or Girl Friends? Or maybe…”
She drops all the books she is holding and moves quickly over to her bed. She pulls out a pink glittery box that says “Misaki’s childhood stuff”. When she lifts off the lid and removes the false bottom, I gasp. In her box are piles and piles of hentai and erotic dojinshi.  She looks up at me with a mischievous glint in her eyes. 
“Is this what you want, Haruki-kun?”

Haruki
“I…er…wow, you sure have a wide range of genres…” 

Misaki
(smirk)
“You look kind of uncomfortable, Haruki-kun.”
She puts the lid back on the hentai box and slides it under her bed. 
“Don’t be an idiot, I’m just holding onto those for my friend.”

Haruki
“Mhm…suuuuure.”

Misaki
(enraged blush? Embarrassed blush?)
“L-LIKE YOU DON’T HAVE SECRET HENTAI. I’M GOING TO COME INTO YOUR ROOM WHEN YOU’RE SLEEPING AND SEARCH IT!”

Haruki
“Wow, that sounds a little creepy.”

*SFX SLAP*

Misaki
(enraged blush)
“SHUT UP, HARUKI-KUN!”
I laugh, despite the pain in my cheek. She’s acting just like we used to. We walk over to her bookshelf once more and I grab her copy of Fruits Basket. 


Haruki
“Can I take this?”

Misaki
(normal)
“Fruits Basket? You haven’t read that yet? Sure, go ahead!”

Haruki
“Thanks!” 
I grab her copies of Fruits Basket, and I stack them up in my arms. 

Misaki
(smile or normal?)
“Hey, Haruki-kun, remember when we used to play Fruits Basket together in grade school? WE SHOULD PLAY IT AGAIN RIGHT NOW!”

I smile, remembering my childhood school days with Kosuke and Misaki. We did used to play Fruits Basket a lot. Although I haven’t played it since I moved away. 

Haruki
“That sounds fun…but we can’t play Fruits Basket now…it requires a large group! Even if we could get Kosuke and your parents, we still wouldn’t have enough people for a proper game of it. Maybe in the future, when I have some more friends.”


Misaki
(excited)
“TOTALLY! We could probably get Riku-senpai and Kokona-chan from work to play! Ooh, and Sora-kun and Yuta-kun and Megumi-chan!”

I don’t recognize these names, but I suppose that they are more of my future coworkers. 

Haruki
“Sora, Yuta and Megumi? Do they all work at the cafe?”

Misaki
“Yup! They sure do! And I’m certain that they would play fruits basket with us!”

Haruki
“Yeah!”

I’ve grown tired of carrying all these books, they’re getting heavy. 

Haruki
“I guess I should probably go back to my room now.”

Misaki
“No you don’t!”
She moves across the room and closes the door.
“C’mon, you promised to have fun with me all night, you can’t go to bed now! It’s way too early!”

Haruki
“Well, I mean, Fruits Basket is 23 books, that’s enough for now, I don’t need anything else to read.”

Misaki
“So let’s do something else fun! Like a dramatic reading or something! YEAH, LET’S DO THAT!”

She moves over to her bookshelf and begins looking through all her options. 

Haruki
“Haha, OK, but nothing from the hentai box, OK?”

Misaki
(smirk)
“Are you sureeeeeee?”

Haruki
“Yes!”

She laughs, and so do I. In the end, we read various scenes from Black Butler. She plays Sebastian and has me play Ciel. It’s pretty fun, and we make it through the first ten books, each of us taking on more and more characters as the series goes on. She takes Finny, I take Meyrin and Baldo. She gets Madam Red and Lau, I get Grell. In the end, it’s a lot of fun. Soon, it is pitch black outside her window. I am reading for the Undertaker when a knock on the door silences my speech.
(Misaki and Ms. Kosuke on the screen)

Ms. Kosuke
(horrified)
“Do either of you have any idea what time it is!? I thought Haruki went back to his room hours ago!”

Haruki
“W-what time is it!?”

Ms. Kosuke
“Ten minutes to midnight!” 

Misaki
(horrified)
“WHAT!?”

Ms. Kosuke
(normal)
“You should go to sleep, Misaki-chan. You too, Haruchan. In separate bedrooms.”

She smiles slightly, and exits the room with a polite nod.

Misaki
(furious blush)
“HOW DID YOU LET IT GET SO LATE, IDIOT?”

I don’t see why she’s so angry at me. She is the one who kept me here for our theatrical reading of Black Butler. 

Haruki
“Well, I’m going to be going now. This was fun, though!” 

I pick up my copies of Fruits Basket, and I quickly exit the room, closing her door behind me. 
(Misaki no longer on screen. Probably shouldn’t still be her room?)
When I pass Kosuke’s room on the way back to my own, it is dark. I’d planned to say hello to him, but it appears that he is already asleep. 
(no one on screen, Haruki’s room)
In my room, I place my newly acquired books on the bedside table. I yawn, and decide that it is too late to start the series tonight. Turning off the light, I climb into bed and fall asleep.

Option 2 – Kosuke (Kosuke Points)
Misaki
(Angry)
“WHAT AN IDIOTIC CHOICE, HARUKI-KUN!”



Kosuke
(smug)
“Ha! You’re just mad because he chose me. You made the right choice Haruki-kun~!”

Misaki seems too upset to respond, and she storms off muttering something about ‘when a cute girl invites you into her bedroom you shouldn’t say no’. 

(Only Kosuke on screen now)

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Wow, Misaki-chan’s pretty crazy, right? I wasn’t kidding about those diary entries and pictures you know~!”

Haruki
“Err…right.”

Kosuke
(happy)
“Or maybe I am joking? Haha, you’ll never know I guess~!”
(normal)
“But we’re wasting time, let’s go play!”

Kosuke runs off in the direction of his room, leaving me to wonder if I should have gone with Misaki. Does she really have pictures and diary entries!?

Kosuke
(happy)
“Hey, Haruki-kun, what are you waiting for!?”

Shaking out of my pensive daze, I follow after him. We return to his room, and he walks over to his game shelf. 

Kosuke
(happy)
“What do you want to play?”

Haruki
“Hmmm, not sure…”

Kosuke
(fake serious? Teacher-y? fake stern?)
“This is serious business, Haruchan. If we play the wrong thing, it could ruin our friendship. FOREVER.”

Haruki
“So it’s a no to Mario Party, then?”

Kosuke
(excited/happy)
“THAT’S THE SPIRIT, HARUCHAN~!”
He looks through his game shelf, pulling out several cases and putting them back. He continues silently in this way for several minutes before finally speaking up. 

Kosuke
(excited/happy)
“OK, HARUCHAN! I HAVE THE GAME FOR US! WE’RE GOING TO PLAY…DANCE. DANCE. REVOLUTION. X!!!!”
He pulls the game off his shelf with a flourishing gesture, and shoves it in my face. 
“AND YOU CAN BET THAT WE’RE GOING TO PLAY KOKO SOKO AND SUKI MELO~! YOU’D BETTER SING ALONG, HARUCHAN, I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THE WORDS!”

Without waiting for my response, Kosuke puts the disc into his game console and pulls out the two DDR mats. Flashing me a bright smile, he turns on the game console and gestures for me to take my place beside him.

(time pass or something? Can we PLEASE. PLEASE. PLEASE. PLEASE. PLEASE. Get Koko Soko or Suki Melo to play during this part? I will ACTUALLY cry.)

Kosuke
(while the DDR music plays)
(smiling)
“YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT, HARUCHAN!”

Haruki
“I’m…trying! This song is fast, I haven’t played in forever!”
Kosuke
(smiling)
“Yeah, but if I totally beat you it’s not as fun as if it’s super close! Plus you aren’t even singing along!”

Haruki
“I’m….TRYING~!”

(more music playing, no dialogue, just music and Kosuke smiling)
(after a little bit of music)

Kosuke
“Wow, you just missed ten steps in a row!”

SFX DDR STEPS MISSED

Haruki
“SHOULDN’T YOU BE FOCUSING ON YOUR OWN DANCE MOVES!?!”

Kosuke
(smirk)
“I don’t need to! At this rate, I could beat you with my eyes closed!” 

Haruki
“So do it!”

Kosuke
(surprised)
“WHAT!?”

Haruki
“If you’re so confident that you could beat me with your eyes closed, do it!”

Kosuke
(V-for-victory pose?)
“CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!”
(his eyes close)

(no dialogue)
(music)
SFX STEPS MISSED, STEPS GAINED, DDR NOISES AND MUSIC. 

(music ends)

Kosuke
(smirks)
“You still lost that round.”

Haruki
“Yeah, well…IT WAS A LOT CLOSER THAT TIME!”

Kosuke
(“I’m done with your shit” smile)
“I had my eyes closed.”

Haruki
“FINE! LET’S GO AGAIN! EYES OPEN, AND I’M GOING TO BEAT YOU!”

Kosuke
(happy)
“YOU’D BETTER SING ALONG THIS TIME, HARUCHAN!”

(time passing)
(music)
SFX DDR NOISES
(screen gradually darkens to signal night)
(DDR MUSIC STOPS)

We play DDR for hours, until we are both out of breath and sweating through our clothes. Kosuke makes me play Suki Melo over twenty times in a row until I finally sang along. By the end, we are both dancing around and acting like pop stars, screaming lyrics in falsetto at the top of our lungs. When Kosuke finally turns off the console, I collapse on his floor.

Kosuke
(tired)
“Wow…we sure played for a long time…”
SFX YAWN 

Haruki
“Yeah…I’m out of breath and pretty tired…”

I glance over at Kosuke’s digital clock. It reads 12:30 AM. How did it get so late!?!

Kosuke
“Wow…Haru-chan, is that the time!?! We should really go to bed, we have to get up early for work tomorrow…”

I stand up, yawning. 

Haruki
“Thanks again for helping me get this job!”

Kosuke
(smile)
“Yeah, anything for you Haru-chan~! I really, really want to work with you, so it’s not like I’m not getting anything out of it!”

He gently punches me in the arm, and I laugh. Then I yawn again. I’m so tired that I can barely stand, and I feel my center of balance shifting ever so slightly from side to side. 


Haruki
“Goodnight, Kosuke!”

Kosuke
“Goodnight, Haru-chan~!”
He pauses before adding
“Hey, thanks for choosing me over Misaki tonight…”

This addition surprises me. I know that he and Misaki have some sort of sibling rivalry over me, but it sounds like he would have been legitimately hurt if I had chosen Misaki over him. However, all I can manage in response is

Haruki
“Huh?”

Kosuke
(embarrassed)
“Oh, no, it’s nothing. Night, Haru-chan.”

He waves off my inquiry with a dismissive wave of his hand and suddenly I get the overbearing feeling that I have just missed my chance to hear something important. 
Giving a warm smile which Kosuke returns, I leave his room. I look back at Misaki’s room, hoping to say a quick goodnight to her before going to bed, but I find her room to be dark. She must be asleep already. 
Returning to my room, I find a stack of Fruits Basket manga on my bedside table. There’s a handwritten note attached to the top book in the stack and I pull it off. 
Hey, Haruki-kun, I know you haven’t read this before. Remember when we used to play fruits basket in elementary school? It was a lot of fun. Sorry that I couldn’t spend time with you tonight, but I figured that you would like this. See you bright and early tomorrow~!
~Misaki

I guess Misaki left these here for me to read. I’ve been wanting to read this series, I wonder how she knew. 

I yawn yet again. Turning off the light, I fall asleep the second my head hits the pillow. 

Option 3 – The lame-ass non-committal pathetic option (no points loser)

Misaki
(horrified)
“WHAT!?!”

Kosuke
(horrified)
“Are…are you serious!?!”

They both seem pretty upset. I had planned to upset neither of them with this neutral response. I guess that kinda backfired. 

Haruki
“Uh…yeah…I’m tired and I’m going to start working tomorrow…”
Kosuke
(still horrified)
“Aww, but it’s still early…”

Misaki
“Yeah…you promised to hang out with us...”

Kosuke
“The café isn’t even hard work. You can get by on maybe two hours of sleep, three tops!”

I feel pretty awkward now. I had hoped it would be an easy out. I guess I did not think through this very well. 

Haruki
“Well, I mean…I was travelling all day. I’m just, tired, that’s all. I promise I’ll spend time with you guys tomorrow, it’s just that…”

I trail off, I do not really have anything else to say to validate my choice. Now I feel a blush creeping its way onto my cheeks, and the tips of my ears feel hot. 

(Mr. Kasai and Ms. Kasai on screen)

Ms. Kasai
“It’s perfectly fine, Haru-chan!”


Mr. Kasai
“It’s perfectly natural to get tired after extended traveling.”

Ms. Kasai
“You shouldn’t feel guilty for needing sleep, Haru-chan, Kosuke and Misaki can wait until tomorrow to catch up with you.”

Mr. Kasai
“It’s admirable that you want to be well-rested to make a good impression on Riku-san tomorrow.”  

Haruki
“Thank you, Mr. Kasai…”

Mr. Kasai
(smile)
“Of course. Goodnight!”

Ms. Kasai
“Goodnight, Haru-chan!”

Haruki
“Goodnight.”

(Mr. and Ms. Kasai are replaced by Kosuke and Misaki)

Kosuke
(upset)
“Sorry about making you feel bad…but we have to hang out tomorrow, OK?”

Haruki
“Haha, it’s a deal!”

Misaki
(smirk)
“Not if I get to him first tomorrow!”

Haruki
“I’ll see you two in the morning~!”

I smile and wave as I walk away back to my room, and they wave back and exchange a competitive glare with each other. 

(scene shift to Haruki’s room. No one on screen)

Admittedly, I had lied about being tired. I just really did not want to choose between them. I look over at my bed. I don’t feel even remotely interested in sleeping just yet. The sun still paints the sky violet outside my window, it isn’t even fully dark yet. 
I turn off my light; I need to give at least the illusion that I am sleeping. Moving silently over to my desk, I grab my gaming device and my headphones. Putting the headphones on my ears I move over to my bed and get under the covers. I silently laugh at myself, I am like a child staying up past their bedtime and trying to hide it from their parents. 
I don’t know how much time elapses while I play video games. I once again complete the story mode of Kid Icarus Uprising before playing at least an hour of Light vs. Dark wifi battles. When I finally emerge from the covers, it is pitch black out my window. I take off my headphones and listen. The house is silent, everyone else must be asleep. 
I yawn. I guess I’m starting to get tired too. I check the clock on my handheld and it reads 1:01 AM. So much for going to bed early. Turning off my handheld and silently returning it to its place on my desk, I return to my bed. But takes me a few minutes to fall asleep, but then I am out cold. 

ALL TIMELINES MERGE ONCE MORE. 

(Screen is black and darkens at the end of each timeline when he mentions falling asleep. The screen is now black until I say so.)

Kosuke
“Haruki-kun~!!!!”

The voice comes from somewhere in the inky blackness. Somewhere far away. 

Misaki
“Hey, time to wake up~!!!”

Another voice, almost certainly Misaki’s. 

Kosuke
“If you don’t wake up, we’re going to be late!”

Misaki
“Hey! Don’t you want to see me in my adorable uniform, Haruki-kun!?!?”

Kosuke
“Maybe you should give him a kiss to wake him up, like Sleeping Beauty!”

SFX SLAP

Misaki
“Why don’t you give him a kiss, idiot?”

Kosuke
“Maybe I will!”

Misaki
“Wait, you aren’t actually going to do it, are you!?!”

Kosuke
“Maybe I will!”

Misaki
“No! If anyone gets to kiss Haruki-kun while he’s sleeping, it’s going to be me!!!” 

I am fully conscious now, and I’ve decided that this has gone far enough. 

(screen brightens to Haruki’s room with Kosuke and Misaki on screen. they are dressed in their uniforms.)

I gasp, nearly hitting my head on Kosuke and Misaki, both of whom are leaning over my face. They appear not to have realized I have awoken as both are currently pushing and shoving each other in an attempt to be closer to me. 

Haruki
“Good morning…”

They both immediately stop fighting and look embarrassed. 

Misaki
(blush. Maid uniform)
“G-good morning, Haruki-kun! I came here to wake you up so I would be the first face you saw when you woke up!”

She mutters something else, but I can only make out the word “future”. 

Kosuke
(blush? Or smirk. Male Maid Uniform)
“Actually, I was the one who came here to get you. She just tagged along.” 

Misaki
(angry)
“Not true!”

Kosuke
(angry)
“Yes it is!!!”

I laugh. Will they ever stop fighting over me? Evidently not. I get out of bed, stretching and yawning. 

Haruki
“How long until we have to be at work?” 

Misaki
“A half hour!”

Kosuke
“Yup. So you should probably get changed. We’ll leave so you can do that.”
(smirk)
“Unless Misaki wants to stay and watch.” 

I feel the blush immediately. Why does he keep saying things like that?

SFX SLAP

Misaki
“Shut up!!!”


Kosuke
(smirk)
“I’m just tossing out the option~!”

SFX SLAP

Kosuke
(hurt)
“Ow, geez, can’t take a joke, can you sis?”

I laugh awkwardly, and the two leave shutting the door behind them.
(No one on screen)
 I quickly open the closet and change into the first outfit I can find. It does not really matter what I wear, of course, if I get a job I’ll just have to change into the uniform anyway. 
(shift to previous eating background)
Fully changed I exit my room, joining Misaki and Kosuke at the breakfast table. They are eating okayu, and another bowl of it sits in the seat between the two of them. I assume it is for me. 
The three of us eat quickly, eager to get to the café. When we are finished eating, we clean off our dishes and head towards the door. 
(Mr. Kasai on screen)
Mr. Kasai hands us each a bag of onigiri on our way out the door.

Mr. Kasai
“Here, for lunch today! I packed you a kamaboko, Haruki-kun, for good luck!”

Haruki
“Thank you, Kasai-san!” 

Mr. Kasai
(smiling)
“Good luck at work today, tell us how it goes when we get home!”

(Kosuke comes on screen)

Kosuke
“We might be home later than usual, I kinda want to show Haruki-kun around Maura.” 

Mr. Kasai
“That’s alright, just don’t stay out too late. And remember to have fun!”

Haruki
“Thanks, Kasai-san! Thank you again for letting me stay here, too!”

Mr. Kasai
“It’s our pleasure! You’re practically our favorite child!”

Kosuke
(shocked)
“Dad!?!?”

Mr. Kasai
“I’m only joking…mostly.”

He laughs and tousles Kosuke’s hair. Now all four of us are laughing. 

Mr. Kasai
“But you three should get going, you’re going to be late! Mom’s already left.”

Haruki
“Bye, Kasai-san!”

Kosuke
“Bye dad!”

(Mr. Kasai disappears and Misaki takes his place. This is permanent.)

Misaki
“Bye~!”

We exit the house, and Misaki and Kosuke lead me down the path towards the commercial center I had seen yesterday on the way to the Kasai house. 

(INT. Kasai House is replaced by generic green field of Maura. Probably the same scene used for the opening of the game. Kosuke and Misaki (in their uniforms) are still on screen)

As we walk, we talk more about Kosuke and Misaki’s parents. 

Haruki
“So, what does your mom do for a living?”

Kosuke
“Mom? She works at a medical research company based in Maura. They’ve developed cures for all sorts of things! And mom’s the head researcher!”

Haruki
“Wow, that’s really impressive! That’s why you moved out here, right?”

Misaki
“Right, Haruki-kun~! Mom’s company relocated and promised her the promotion if she moved with it!”

Now that I think about it, I do remember her telling my mother something like that right before the Kasai family moved. 

Haruki
“Wow, you must be pretty proud of her!”

Kosuke
(beaming)
“I am! It’s my hope that one day…”
(shadowed face, upset)
“She’ll develop a cure for Kokona-chan.”

I am surprised by his sudden change in expression and the sudden gravity of his tone. Wasn’t Kokona the name of the coworker he mentioned? Why does she need a cure?

Haruki
“Kokona-chan? Why does she need a cure?”

Kosuke
(upset still)
“Oh it’s um…well…she’s…uh…”

Misaki
(also serious)
“We really don’t like talking about it.” 

Haruki
“Oh…sorry…”

They both seem close to tears and I wonder why. 

Misaki
“Besides, Kokona should tell you herself if she wants to.”


Haruki
“Sorry again for asking about it…”

Kosuke
(sad)
“It’s fine, I shouldn’t have mentioned it.”

I cannot think of a response and our walk becomes silent. I think about what they’ve told me about Kokona in the past. That she’s really sweet. That’s all that they have said up until this point. What could it be about her that she needs a cure? 

Despite my lingering questions, I know that inquiring further will do nothing for me other than make Kosuke and Misaki more upset. So I revert the conversation back to its original subject. 

Haruki
“So, what about your dad, does he work at all?”

Kosuke
(confused)
“Huh?”

They seem distracted and surprised that I have resumed the conversation.



Kosuke
(normal)
“Dad? No, not really. He’s never really been the office type. He’s pretty much just a homemaker but he has an online specialty bento business. He’s really good at making themed bento.”

Haruki
“Wow, really?”

Misaki
(proud)
“Yeah! And he’s teaching me! Someday I’ll have to make you a themed bento of your favorite anime!”

Kosuke
(jealous)
“Hey! I wanted to be the one to make Haruki-kun a special bento!”

They are arguing over me again. Can they even make it ten minutes in my presence without doing so?

Misaki
(angry)
“NO! Only I can make Haruki-kun special bento!”



Kosuke
(smirk)
“Yeah, because you’re so in love with him and you want to be his special little—“

SFX SLAP

Misaki
(enraged)
“I am not in love with Haruki-kun, you idiot. And you act the same way around him, so maybe you’re the one who’s in love with Haruki-kun!”

Kosuke
(blush)
“Shut up, that’s ridiculous. We’re just best friends, that’s all!” 

Misaki
(smirk)
“Then why were you going to kiss him this morning?”

Kosuke
(angry)
“Why were YOU going to!?!”



Misaki
(angry)
“Don’t mention that in front of Haruki-kun, you idiot!”

Kosuke
(enraged)
“You brought it up!!!”

By now, we’ve entered the commercial center of Maura.
(scene shift to city street Maura backdrop) 
Another silence descends on our group as we walk down the crowded streets of Maura. Occasionally, Kosuke and Misaki glare at each other, but I decide not to comment on what they were saying. Or the fact that I heard everything they said in the morning. I figure that it’s for the best if neither knows that I know. 

(Shift to EXT. Café (is this a separate backdrop from the street?))

Kosuke
(smiling)
“We’re here, Haruki-kun~!”

Misaki
(happy)
“Isn’t it adorable?”

The Café, the name of which appears to be “Ganbatte” as displayed by a coffee cup shaped sign above the door, is a long one-story building constructed of old brick. It is situated on the corner of a street, and most of the walls facing the street are taken up by large windows shaded by white and pink striped awnings. In the windows I see people of all ages eating pastries and sipping drinks. Some are reading. Reading all sorts of things. Books. Manga. Light Novels. The newspaper. Some of them are writing. Others type on laptops or talk on phones. A girl who looks to be about my age is sitting in a corner booth eating daifuku and playing a handheld (Note to artists and whoever, IDK if it matters, but the girl he mentions here is Aiko). It looks warm and lively. This will be a fun place to work, I was wrong about it not being my type of work environment. 

SFX CAR HORN HONK

A car horn sounds, reminding me that I am taking this scene in from the middle of the street. I quickly dodge the car and run to join Kosuke and Misaki on the sidewalk outside Ganbatte. 

Kosuke
“Ready to go inside? Prepare to enter paradise!” 

At first, I think he is exaggerating. People call subpar places “paradise” all the time. Paradise is subjective. But then…we enter the door.

SFX BELL RING

(INT. GANBATTE CAFÉ)

As soon as we push open the door and the little bell chimes out, the smell hits me. The beautiful, wonderful, ambrosial scent that fills every corner of this building. The smell reminds me of when I was younger, when my mother was baking bread and cakes. It’s warm too. Being inside Ganbatte feels like sitting next to a fireplace on a cold winter night. All around me is a cacophony of voices, happy voices and excited voices and cheerful voices. There are no sad voices or angry voices. No screaming or shouting or crying. This place is wonderful. This place is home. 

I stare at the counter and I gasp. The counter runs the entire length of the café and contains more sweets and pastries than I have ever seen in one place in my entire life. Jars and jars of multicolored konpeito sit atop the counter, with lollipop trees next to them. Beneath the glass of the counter I see rows and rows of wagashi, a myriad of multicolored dango, pyramids of daifuku, hundreds of anpan, a whole sea of taiyaki, manju…monaka, onigiri of all shapes, colors and sizes, suama, uiro, yokan…a limitless spread of flavors and colors. Drink machines sit on the wall behind the counter, and workers dressed like Kosuke and Misaki mill about between the machines and the counter. They take the orders of customers with a smile. Occasionally they pass in and out of a door that I suppose must lead to the kitchens. 

Misaki
(happy)
“Pretty sweet, huh?”

Kosuke
(laughing)
“You ok, Haruki-kun? You look like you’re going to have a heart attack!”

Haruki
“It’s so…beautiful…”

Kosuke and Misaki exchange a look and a laugh before Misaki steps forward and waves in the direction of the counter.
Misaki
(some sort of loud expression IDK)
“Hey, Riku-senpai, we’re here~!”

One of the workers turns around, somehow managing to cringe and smile at the same time. 

(Riku is now on screen, replacing Kosuke and Misaki)
He appears to be in his early twenties, probably twenty one or twenty two, with messy hair and some stubble. He’s wearing the same uniform as Kosuke, but his has a little gold nametag on it that reads “manager”.

Riku
(normal probably)
“Morning, Misaki-chan! Morning, Kosuke-kun! You guys are a few minutes late, I might have to fire you!”

He laughs, and I know that he isn’t serious. 

Riku
“Hey, who’s that with you? New customer?”

(Kosuke added to screen)

Kosuke
“Riku-san, meet Haruki Nishihara!”

Riku
(wondering)
“Haruki Nishihara? That boy that you and Misaki wouldn’t stop talking about all week?”

Somehow I am not even remotely surprised that they have been talking about me all week. 

Kosuke
(smile)
“Yeah, that’s the one! I want you to give him a job!”

Riku
(surprised)
“A job!?! You show up here late and you want me to hire your friend?” 

Kosuke
(puppy eyes or the like)
“C’mon, Riku-san! He’s just as hard a worker as me and Misaki!”

Riku
(smug)
“Is that supposed to be a good thing?”



Kosuke
(upset)
“Riku-san? How can you say that? Plus, just look at his face!”

Kosuke wraps his arm around me to pull me in and uses his free hand to grab my face, squishing my cheeks as he moves it around.

Kosuke
(smile)
“He’s pretty cute, right? Sales would probably skyrocket!”

Riku
(smiles)
“OK, OK, you’ve made enough of a scene, he’s hired. We’ve been short one ever since Hiro quit anyway.” 

Kosuke
(triumphant)
“Hell yeah!”

Haruki
“Thank you, sir!”

I bow respectfully, but Riku only laughs.


Riku
(smile)
“Don’t be so formal! Call me Riku. Or Riku-sama, whichever you feel like!” 

Haruki
“Thank you, Riku. I’m Haruki Nishihara…but I guess you already know my name.”

I hold out my hand, and he shakes it.

Riku
(smile)
“Yeah, your little friends made sure of that.”

He shoots Misaki and Kosuke a sarcastically annoyed look. I can already tell that Riku is going to be a fun boss.

Riku
“Riku Matsumoto, by the way, and remember that name. I’m going to make it big one day, and I want you to be able to say ‘I knew him when’!” 

He laughs, and I look to Kosuke.

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Riku-san’s got a lot of big plans. They’re all pretty delusional!”
Riku
(fake annoyed)
“Hey! What kind of treatment of your boss is that!?”

Kosuke shrugs and Riku shakes his head, turning his attention back to me. 

Riku
(smirk or something)
“Don’t turn into a third one of them, ok?”

Haruki
“I don’t think I’d be able to even if I tried!”

Riku
“Fine by me! Anyway, there’s a few spare uniforms in the back. Kosuke! Why don’t you show Haruki where the extra uniforms are? Then we can give him some training and introduce him to the other workers!”

Kosuke
(salute)
“Yes, sir, Riku-sama, sir!” 

Riku
(annoyed)
“Unnecessary.”

(Riku no longer on screen)

Kosuke laughs, and links arms with me. He leads me back behind the counter and into the kitchens. From there we enter a small supply closet with extra male and female uniforms. 

(INT. SUPPLY CLOSET)

Kosuke pulls one of the female uniforms off the shelf.  

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Here, Haru-chan, this one’s for you!” 

OPTIONS
1.	Get Offended
2.	Play Along

OPTION ONE –OFFENDED (Negative Kosuke points ;_; ) 

Haruki
“That’s the girl’s uniform, Kosuke.”

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Yeah? Well I think you’d look good in it!”

I roll my eyes and put the uniform back.

Haruki
“Enough messing around.”

Kosuke
(upset)
“Wow, Haru-chan, it was just a joke.”

I roll my eyes again.

Haruki
“Not a very funny one.”

OPTION TWO- PLAY ALONG (Kosuke Points)

Haruki
“Oh really?”

I take the uniform from him and I hold it up to myself.

Haruki
“Think I could pull it off?”

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Totally. You’d look really cute in it!”

I smile and laugh, tossing the uniform back to him.

Haruki
“If you think it’s so cute, let’s see you wear it!

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Maybe I will!” 

I laugh.

Haruki
“I’d love to see that!”

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Maybe you will!”

TIMELINE MERGE. 


Kosuke
(normal or sad depending on your path)
“Anyway, here’s your actual uniform.”

He returns the female uniform to the rack and grabs a male uniform. He hands it to me and I accept it with a smile. 


Haruki
“Thanks!”

Kosuke
(smile)
“Don’t mention it Haru-chan~! Just change into that and meet me back by the front counter!”

He does a little salute, and leaves the closet. 

(Kosuke no longer on screen)

As soon as he’s gone I quickly strip off my casual clothes and replace them with the uniform. I examine myself in the mirror. (Art Screen of Haruki looking at himself in the mirror?) I look pretty good in the uniform, I think. I quickly style my hair with my hands, and I smooth out the wrinkles in my clothes. 

I think of the name of the café. Ganbatte. Ganbatte…good luck, do your best in life. 
I move close to the mirror, so that I am looking into my own eyes. 

Haruki
“Ganbatte, Haruki Nishihara.”

I back away from the mirror, and I leave the closet. Kosuke is waiting for me.

(INT. GANBATTE CAFÉ)

(Kosuke on screen)

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Did I hear you talking to yourself, Haru-chan?” 

I feel myself blushing.

Haruki
“N-no!”

Kosuke
(smile)
“Ehh, it’s fine, no need to get flustered! You look really good in that uniform!”


Haruki
“Thank you.” 

Kosuke smiles and I smile back. He takes me back through the kitchens and out to the main counter, where Riku has gathered all the workers. 
(Riku replaces Kosuke on screen)

Riku
(happy)
“Hey, Haruki! Wow, you look pretty nice.”

Haruki
“Thanks.”

I wonder if it’s true, or if they’re all just being polite.

Riku
(normal)
“So, these are your coworkers.”

He gestures to the four people standing behind him. 

Riku
“Alright, from left to right, why don’t you guys introduce yourselves to Haruki Nishihara?”

(Megumi appears on screen with Riku)

Megumi
(excited or loud expression)
“Hi! Megumi Ikehara, that’s my name! You can call me Gumi-chan if you want, that’s my stage name! I’m an actress~! I starred in my school’s production of Les Misérables, I was Eponine. I can do some of my lines from that if you’d like…! Um… ? On my ownnn~”

She starts to sing, and Riku’s face falls. She has a nice voice, but I have a feeling that Riku has to deal with this on a daily basis. 

Riku
(defeated)
“Thank you, Megumi, but we unfortunately have to get to the others. We do have customers…”

Megumi
(realization)
“Right! Sorry, Riku~!”

(Megumi is replaced by Yuta on screen)

Yuta
(general expression, quiet)
“Hello. I am Yuta Arakawa. I publish a new installment of my horror dojinshi every month…have you heard of them?”
Haruki
“It’s possible, what are they about?”

Yuta
(some sort of sadistic excitement)
“Well, my longest running and current one is about several covens of witches. Each one is supported by a demon like Amanojaku or Kumo Yokai and they must perform bloody sacrifices to their demons in which they must tear open the victim and pull off their skin to be made into a robe for the head of the coven to wear for the remainder of the ceremony and then they pull out their organs to be made into—“

Riku
(ill)
“Yuta…the customers…” 

At the counter, several customers are exchanging uncomfortable glances.

Yuta
(realization face)
“Ohhh, right. I’m not supposed to go into the gory details in front of the customers anymore…”

Yuta seems ashamed and he steps silently back into line.  

(Sora replaces Yuta)

Sora
(energetic)
“Hiya~! Sora Takayama, future billionaire! I mean, I’m working here obviously, but just you wait, OK? I’ve got a lot of ideas, I just need the money to put them together!”

Haruki
“Wow, really? Like what?”

Sora
(horrified or mischievous)
“No, No, No, Nishihara-kun. When future billionaires tell their plans to random people they’ve just met, they go from future billionaire to future could-have-been-a-billionaire! I mean, how do I know that you’re not some corporate spy from one of the big companies, here to find out the secret to my…Oh, wow, you’re good. You almost got me to admit my ideas to you!”

Haruki
“I didn’t say a…”

Sora
(horrified)
“No, stop! Don’t tempt me you corporate spy! I’ll never tell you how I plan to…DAMMIT! You almost had me again…damn you’re good…”

He slowly walks back into line, staring nervously into my eyes. Is anyone who works here normal?

Riku
(tired looking/ so done)
“Alright, Kokona, your turn.”

The final worker steps forward, another girl. 

(Kokona Machida makes her appearance)

She is very pretty, but there also seems to be something off about her. She’s extremely pale. More than just your standard ashen, though, a truly unhealthy pale. Her eyes are kind and yet also tired, and they seem to hold some sort of latent sadness in them. Sadness which must have been felt years ago yet still lingers. 

And then, her name registers with me. Kokona. The girl who needs a cure. 

Kokona
(demure, sweet, innocent too pure cinnamon bun)
“Hi…my name is Kokona Machida. I’m pleased to meet you, Haruki Nishihara…”

Her voice is very quiet. 

Haruki
“Thank you, pleased to meet you too, Kokona Machida!”


Kokona
(cute, cinnamon bun too pure, too innocent)
“You…You may call me Kokona-chan…if you want to. I’m not very formal…”

Haruki
“Ok, Kokona-chan.”

Kokona
“I, um, I wish I had something interesting to say about myself. I’m not really like Gumi-chan or Yuta-kun or Sora-kun, though…I haven’t really accomplished much and I’m not very interesting. I’m sorry!”

I’m surprised by her apology. She seems so sad about not having anything to say and she seems to believe that she deserves to feel bad about it. 

Haruki
“It’s ok, really! I’m sure you’re really interesting!”

Kokona
(blush)
“Um…thank you…I hope we can talk more.”

I smile at her. She seems really sweet, just like everyone said. 

Haruki
“I do too.”
Kokona smiles at me and then returns to the line. 

A moment later I feel a gentle punch on my arm. 

(Misaki replaces Riku and Kokona)

Misaki
(smug)
“Were you just flirting with Kokona-chan?”

Haruki
“N-no, that’s…no!” 

I feel my face get red.

Misaki
(smug)
“Mhm, sure.”

Haruki
“I…uh…”

Before I can think of a defense, Riku begins to speak. I silently thank him. 

(Riku on screen)
Riku
“Alright, that’s everyone! I hope you enjoy working here, Haruki. Speaking of work, I think we should be getting back to it? If we want to make any money.”

Sora, Yuta and Megumi nod their agreement and drift off, Megumi and Sora going to the kitchens while Yuta takes the counter. Somehow I wonder if Yuta’s the best choice for the person giving food to the customers. 

Riku
“Alright, Haruki, since it’s your first day, I’ll let you work the counter. It’s easier than the kitchens, and more fun. You’ll work with Kokona, Kosuke and Yuta. Sora, Megumi, Misaki, you three take the kitchens.”
(Smirk)
 “Try not to set any more fires, OK, Misaki?”

(Misaki on screen)

Misaki
(outraged)
“That was one time!”

Riku
(facepalm-y thing)
“Sixteen. Sixteen times.”



Misaki
(shrug)
“One time, sixteen times, who’s really counting?”

Riku
(facepalm)
“The fire department. They have our pictures at the fire station.”

Misaki
(shrug)
“Dad says that learning to cook is a process!”

Riku
(facepalm)
“Well, most of the time, this learning process doesn’t get you on the “most likely to commit arson” watch-list.”

Misaki laughs in response, and disappears into the kitchens.

Riku
“Alright, have fun! Kokona, Kosuke, you two make sure he stays on track…and make sure Yuta isn’t talking about dismemberment again…”

(Kosuke on screen with Riku)


Kosuke
(sarcastic salute)
“Yes, sir, Riku-sama, sir!”

Riku rolls his eyes, and gives me a look. 

Riku
(‘I am so done with your shit’ face)
“You’re mocking me again.”

Kosuke
“Yes, sir, Riku-sama, sir!”

Riku
“Why did I even hire you? And, more importantly, why have I not fired you yet?”

Kosuke
(smile)
“Because I’m too lovable!”

Riku rolls his eyes and Kosuke winks at him before heading over to the counter to take the order of a teenage boy standing at the counter. 

(Kosuke leaves screen)


Riku
“Good luck out there, with coworkers like these, you’re gonna need it!”

He laughs, and drifts away, disappearing into the kitchens. 

(Riku leaves the screen)

(Kokona on screen)

Kokona
(normal/happy/innocent….damn this too pure cinnamon roll…)
“Haruki-kun? Is everything alright, you look upset…”

I realize that I am showing my concern on my face, and I quickly change my expression. 

Haruki
“No, I’m fine, it’s nothing. I was just thinking about something.”

Kokona
“Oh, ok! Well, do you want me to teach you about the counter now? It would be my pleasure.”

Haruki
“Oh, um, sure, thank you!”

Kokona
(sweet adorable kawaii-ass so-sweet-you-get-diabetes-smile)
“Ok! Follow me~!”

She offers me her hand, and I take it. It feels fragile, as if it will come apart in my grip. Kokona leads me over to the counter, where Kosuke and Yuta are serving a couple of men in their mid-forties who appear to be picking up some anpan before arriving at a business meeting. 
(Yuta added to screen)

Yuta
“…now, I must ask, sir, have you perhaps heard of the dojinshi Mahou Akuma? No? Well, it’s quite good, or so I’ve heard. It’s about these covens of witches who…”

Kokona gently taps his shoulder and he turns around.

Yuta
(surprised)
“Yes?”

Kokona
(slightly upset. That face where your hand is on your lip and you look down)
“Um…Riku-san said you aren’t supposed to try to sell your dojinshi to customers anymore, Yuta-kun. Please don’t get yourself fired like this, ok?”


Yuta
(realization face)
“I wasn’t really selling them… just wondering if they’d read them…”

Yuta wanders off to the other side of the counter, muttering to himself about how he’ll never get more sales without word of mouth. 

(Yuta replaced by Kosuke)

Kosuke
(happy)
“Having fun yet, Haruki-kun?” 

Haruki
“Yeah! Everyone seems really nice and interesting!”

Kosuke
(smile)
“Don’t worry, you’ll get used to all of them.”

Haruki
“Well, you are the strangest, so if I got used to you…”

Kosuke
(fake angry)
“Hey!”

Kokona
(giggle)
“Do you and Kosuke-kun always tease each other like this?”

Kosuke
(beaming)
“Hell yeah!”
He puts his arm around my shoulders.

Kosuke
“Haruki-kun and I go way back! We’ve even seen each other naked!”

I feel my face blush quicker than I would have thought possible.

Haruki
“Kosuke…!”

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Well it’s true! We used to go swimming a lot when we were kids.”

Kokona is giggling now.


Kokona
(giggle)
“You two are pretty funny together!”

All at once, however, her laughter stops and her expression changes. 

Kokona
(sad/melancholy)
“I’m kind of jealous of you two…”

Haruki
“Jealous of us…why?”

Kokona
(sad)
“I don’t have any friendships like yours…everyone I knew in my childhood is gone now. The longest friendships I’ve had in my life lasted no more than a few months…I’ve always wondered what it’s like to have a best friend that you’ve known forever.”

I know that I am missing something crucial about this girl. The cure, everyone being “gone”, the sadness in her eyes…

1.	I’ll be your friend (Kokona and Kosuke points, cause, like, Kosuke is touched by the gesture)
2.	That’s Really Sad (no points)

Option 1 – Kokona and Kosuke points

Haruki
“I’ll be your friend, Kokona-chan!”

I shout it without even realizing what I’m saying. 

Haruki
“I’ll be your friend OK? So in years and years you can say that you had a best friend! I’ll…I’ll be the childhood friend you never had. I’ll be your friend for the rest of your life.”

There are tears in my eyes, why are there tears in my eyes? I don’t really feel sad, and I don’t even know where all this is coming from.

To my surprise, Kokona appears to have tears in her eyes too. 

Kokona
(sad/tearful)
“Haruki-kun…you’ve only just met me…and that was one of the sweetest things anyone’s ever said to me. Thank you…thank you so much!”

Even Kosuke seems touched by what I said. 

Kosuke
(touched)
“Wow…that was really sweet…”

Haruki
“Thank you…but I meant it. I wasn’t trying to be super sweet or anything, I was just saying what I felt.”

Kokona
(blush)
“Th-thank you!”

Kosuke looks like he wants to say something else, but cannot seem to find the words. Finally, he says

Kosuke
“Hey, looks like we have a customer.”

Option 2 – No points

Haruki
“Wow, Kokona…that’s really, really sad…it’s honestly one of the saddest things I’ve ever heard.”

Kokona
(upset)
“Yeah…I guess my life has been pretty awful…”


Kosuke
(sad)
“But it’s better now, right, Kokona-chan? I mean, I’m your friend and Misaki’s your friend. And Gumi-chan, and Yuta and Sora. And I’m sure Haruki-kun will be your friend too! Right?”

Haruki
“Of course!”

Kokona
(grateful)
“Thank you.”

Even though she thanks me, she still looks upset. A silence falls over us, and I feel that somehow I botched that response.

For a long minute, we all stare at each other, saying nothing. Finally, Kosuke speaks.

Kosuke
“Hey, looks like we have a customer.”

TIMELINE MERGE

I turn to the counter and see that the girl is a few years older than us. I notice that Kosuke is eyeing her nervously, and edging farther and farther from the counter. 

Kosuke
(awkward)
“Hey, Haruki…you wanna take this one? She’s pretty cute, a good first customer for you, right?”

I notice that all the blood has drained from his face and he looks moments away from passing out. Is his gynophobia really still this bad?

Haruki
“Yeah, I’ve got it.” 

I take her order quickly. She wants three wagashi, a bag on konpeito, and a bubble tea. Kokona makes the bubble tea while I fetch the candy and cakes. We hand them to the customer, and she departs. When she is gone, Kosuke gives me a grateful look.

Kosuke
(grateful)
“Thank you, Haruki-kun…you know how I…you know about my…condition.”

Apparently his gynophobia is still this bad. 

Haruki
“Yeah, no problem.”

Kosuke
“Thanks again!”

He gives me a grateful smile, and we slowly drift off to separate activities as more customers arrive. For the most part, Kosuke and Yuta handle drinks while Kokona and I are in charge of distributing the pastries. Kokona and I do not talk much; Ganbatte seems to have a pretty steady flow of customers. We take our lunch break at around twelve thirty, leaving the counter in Yuta and Kosuke’s hands, and that is when I have my next chance to speak to Kokona. 

I take out my bag of onigiri, and she takes out a small pink bento. We go over to an empty booth and sit across from each other. 

Haruki
“So, when you guys were introducing yourselves to me, you said there wasn’t anything special or interesting about you.”

Kokona
(Blush)
“Yes…I guess I did say that, didn’t I?”

Haruki
“But, that can’t possibly be true, can it?”

Kokona
(surprised)
“Why not?”

I laugh as I take a large bite out of one of my onigiri.

Haruki
“Because everyone has something that makes them special.”

Kokona
(blush)
“Thank you, Haruki-kun…that’s very nice of you to say. But really, it’s true, there’s nothing interesting about me.”

Haruki
“What’s your favorite color?”

Kokona
(giggle)
“I really like orange…and gold. Those colors are pretty.”

Haruki
“That’s something interesting about you!”

Kokona
(giggle)
“No way! Plenty of people like orange and gold.”

Haruki
“Maybe, but it still makes you a more interesting individual. If, say, we all split into factions based on favorite color, I know now that you would go with orange or gold. Which is interesting.”



Kokona
(giggle/happy)
“Well, I mean, when you put it like that…”

Haruki
“So, what about activities outside of work?”

Kokona
(troubled)
“Ummm, I don’t know, I don’t leave home very often…I really like watching movies, though. I like the Ghibli movies a lot…I watched them all the time when I was younger.”

Haruki
“Kosuke, Misaki and I used to watch those movies all the time! Which one is your favorite?” 

Kokona
(Kawaii smile)
“I really liked My Neighbor Totoro. I still watch it all the time. Ooh, but I also like Spirited Away! And Kiki’s Delivery Service!”

She giggles

Kokona
(giggle)
“I guess I like a lot of them!”
I smile as I eat my last onigiri. Kokona is about halfway through her bento. 

Haruki
“See!? You really are interesting! You like orange and gold and you love Ghibli films. You’ve never had a childhood friend, and you eat pink bento boxes with onigiri shaped like Totoro.”

Kokona giggles again

Kokona
(giggle)
“It’s not always Totoro. Yesterday it was No Face. Before that was Jiji. I once even had one of the robots from Castle in the Sky.”

Haruki
“See? You are interesting. You don’t need to be an actress or billionaire-to-be or horror writer…it’s the small things that make people truly interesting.”

Kokona
(blushing)
“Thank you, Haruki-kun. You’re so sweet.”

I return her smile, and I take the kamaboko out of my onigiri bag. I see her looking at it but she says nothing. I smile.

Haruki
“Do you want some of this?”
I break the kamaboko in half. 

Kokona
(blush)
“Oh, no, I couldn’t…it’s yours.”

Haruki
“I insist! Really, I want you to have it. To commemorate our friendship!”

I hold out the unbitten half of the kamaboko, and reluctantly she takes it. We eat it together.

Kokona
(smile)
“That was really good, Haruki-kun! Thank you so much. Here…you shared your food with me, have some of mine!”

Smiling, Kokona extracts a tempura from her bento box and holds it out. 

Kokona
(kawaii smile)
“Lean in please!”

I do, and she puts the tempura in my mouth for me. 


Haruki
“Thanks, Kokona-chan!”

I hear a slightly unsettling giggle next to the table and I turn to look at the source. At some point, Yuta had arrived at the table without us knowing. 

(Yuta on screen with Kokona)

Yuta
(IDK what expression he has…)
“Oh…am I interrupting something? I’ve been watching for a few minutes actually. From a little ways away. Kosuke said that I should take my lunch break. I don’t get what the problem was, I was just educating the customer on gangrene…”

Yuta sits down next to Kokona, eating a taiyaki. 

Yuta
“It was cute dialogue though. Really, I should use something like that in my next chapter. It can be how the head of the Bakeneko coven, Neko Kirisama, lures her next victim for the Neko-Ningen Program arc of Mahou Akuma!”

Kokona and I exchange a slightly horrified glance, and then we both laugh a little.


Haruki
“Damn, Yuta, you’ve exposed my plan! Now I’ll never be able to lure Kokona-chan into my satanic rituals!”

Kokona is laughing a lot now.

Kokona
(giggle)
“Oh…Haruki-kun! Were you only pretending to be nice to me so you could use me for your evil purposes!?”

I place my hand over my heart, feigning defeat.

Haruki
“I would have gotten away with it too, if not for Yuta Arakawa!”

We all laugh. Kokona puts away her empty bento box, and stands up.

Kokona
(normal)
“I think our lunch break is over, Haruki-kun. It would be rude to leave Kosuke all alone at the counter for too long.”

Haruki
“Yeah, you’re right.”

We exit the booth and say goodbye to Yuta. He waves at us distractedly, sketching a witch in a small notebook while working on his second taiyaki. 

(Yuta leaves the screen)
We walk back over to the counter, where Kosuke is handing a twenty-something man a few sticks of dango. The man leaves as we join Kosuke behind the counter. 

(Kosuke on screen)

Kosuke
(sassy playful face)
“Back from your little date?”

Haruki
“I-It wasn’t a date!”

Kosuke
(smirk)
“It sure looked like one! Be careful, Haru-chan, you might make someone jealous!”

I laugh.

Haruki
“Like who, you?”

Kosuke
(laughing)
“As if!”

We laugh, and get back to work. 

The rest of the work day passes quickly. Yuta comes back to the counter almost an hour later, and once again he is relegated to the drinks machine. Kosuke chooses not to take a lunch break, and eats his onigiri at the counter between customers. When he’s finished with the onigiri, he steals four wagashi, saving one for himself and giving the other three to Kokona, Yuta and me. Riku comes out of the kitchen just as he’s doing this, catching Kosuke in the act, but Kosuke shoves an orange wagashi in Riku’s mouth before he can object. He chews it slowly before shrugging and walking back into the kitchen. Kokona and I do not have another real conversation for the rest of the day.

At two thirty, Misaki exits the kitchen, Gumi-chan and Sora with her. I notice that seven more workers have entered the café, although none of them acknowledge me. 

(Megumi and Sora on screen)

Megumi
(Loud, waving goodbye kinda expression)
“Bye everyone~! ? Gumi-chan is out~!! ?” 



Sora
(distracted)
“Bye guys! …I wonder if I could…no, I can’t plan here…I need to get home, draw diagrams, plan it out…”

Gumi-chan puts in a set of earbuds and skips out singing to herself. Sora follows not far after her, typing into his phone and not really watching where he’s walking. He almost runs into the doorframe. 

(Yuta replaces both Megumi and Sora)

Yuta
(normal)
“Ah, it seems our shift is up. Goodbye everyone, thank you for once again providing me ample material for Mahou Akuma.”

Yuta giggles to himself and walks out with a slight wave. 

(Misaki and Kokona on screen, Yuta is gone)

I once again feel Misaki’s light punch in my arm. It is soft and friendly this time. She must no longer be mad at me.

Misaki
(smirk)
“Hey, Haruki-kun. Shift’s up. How was your date with Kokona-chan?”

Haruki
“It wasn’t a date!”

Misaki
(smirk)
“Whatever you say~! But I hope you’re not tired because you’re about to go on a tour of Maura with me and Kosuke! And you’re not getting out of it!”

Haruki
“I wouldn’t even try to.”

Misaki
(smile)
“Good~! Kosuke and I will be waiting by the door. Don’t try anything with Kokona-chan, OK? 
(demonic yandere face)
“Or else.”

I gasp and give her a look but she merely laughs and walks off with Kosuke. They wave at me from the door, and I turn back to Kokona.

Kokona
(giggle)
“Misaki-chan is pretty funny!”

I give Misaki a sidelong glance.

Haruki
“Yeah, she’s pretty interesting.”

Kokona
(sweet, kawaii, cinnamon bun of kawaii)
“So, I’ll see you tomorrow, right?”

Haruki
“Of course!”

Kokona
(smile)
“I’m looking forward to it! Bye, Haruki-kun!” 

She waves with a small gesture and walks away.

(Kokona off screen)

I go over to Kosuke and Misaki, and we go out into the street. 
(street scene)
They are busy, even more so than this morning. I see Gumi-chan, Yuta and Sora all walking off in one direction, and Kokona in the other. In a few seconds, both groups become part of the crowd and I lose them. 

Without warning, Kosuke runs to the edge of the sidewalk and spins around, teetering on the edge and dangerously close to falling into the street.

Kosuke
(Happy. Has he changed from his uniform?)
“Welcome to Maura!”

He grabs my hand, and pulls me out into the street with him. A car passes us, and he pulls me out of the way just in time.

SFX CAR HONK

Haruki
“Kosuke-kun! Be careful, we almost died!”

Kosuke
(happy)
“Maura has so much to do, Haru-chan! I don’t even know where to take you!”

He seems completely unfazed by almost being hit by a car. Unbelievable. 

Haruki
“Well, I don’t really know anything here besides Ganbatte and your house.”



Misaki
(happy)
“There’s tons of stuff here! The arcade, a bunch of cool restaurants, this awesome art museum, the bookstore, the theater, the athletic center, the hospital…”

Kosuke shoots her a look.

Kosuke
(skeptical/wtf. IDK what face this would be)
“Why would Haru-chan want to visit the hospital?”

Misaki
(angry)
“I was just informing him that we have one! What if he gets injured, idiot, what then?”

Kosuke
(normal)
“Well, I thought we were discussing fun places to show him…speaking of which…”
(happy)
“Why don’t we take him to the square? It’s a summer weekday, so the market stalls will be up!”

Haruki
“That sounds like fun!”

Kosuke
(happy)
“It will be!”

Misaki
(smirk)
“And I’ll show you around!”

Misaki grabs my hand and starts running off in the direction I saw Gumi-chan, Yuta and Sora go. 

Kosuke
(upset)
“Hey! Where are you going with Haru-chan! I’m going to lead him around!”

Kosuke runs after us and ends up grabbing my other hand. They pull me forward as I struggle to keep up with them. 
(Cool art screen of Kosuke and Misaki running while holding Haruki’s hands? IDK, if y’all want to)

They pull me through the crowded sidewalks, attracting several disgruntled stares from those we pass. The buildings are all so lively. We pass store after store, filled with clothes and anime merchandise, bento boxes, electronics retailers, bars, bookstores, antiques shops, music stores with huge banners announcing the newest vocaloid programs and Kyary Pamyu Pamyu. This place is so different from our hometown. It was a small village, with only a few houses, a school, and some family owned businesses. Maura may be far from a sprawling urban social epicenter like Tokyo or even Osaka or Nagoya, but it is giant compared to my hometown.  
In a few minutes, we have arrived in the town square. Just as Misaki and Kosuke promised, numerous stalls dot the square selling all manner of colorful goods. Some sell stuffed animals, other sell small accessories. One sells posters. Another, marked “Ashiteru Hon” appears to be selling classic literature from all across the globe. Countless others sell candies, baked goods, and other snack foods. The air here is filled with frenetic chatter as countless shoppers move from stand to stand, purchasing goods. 

Kosuke lets go of my hand, and once again spins in a circle.

Kosuke
(happy)
“Take it all in, Haru-chan! Isn’t it wonderful?”

I let go of Misaki’s hand so I can walk freely.

Haruki
“It’s…it’s amazing. I don’t even know where to go first!” 

Misaki
(smirk)
“There’s a hostess club right over there, Haruki-kun. Want to go there?”

I look where she is pointing. There is a hostess club called the Hana Shoujo. I notice the girl who was eating daifuku and playing a handheld at Ganbatte is standing just outside the doorway. I notice now that her hair is dyed blonde, and her clothes are revealing. She appears to be cajoling men into entering the club. I guess that she works there.

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Why don’t you go there, Misaki, while Haru-chan and I go shopping!”

Misaki
(smirk)
“Well, I know you can’t go in there, Kosuke-kun. You’d piss yourself out of fear.”

(Kosuke face is angry)

Kosuke glares at Misaki, and I can feel the fire burning in his eyes. His fingers are twitching. She hit a nerve. 

1.	Side with Misaki (Misaki points)
2.	Side with Kosuke (Kosuke + Misaki points)

Option 1 – Side with Misaki

Haruki
“It was just a joke, Kosuke, you shouldn’t take it so seriously.”

Kosuke
(Angry)
“Well, I didn’t find it funny. It offended me.”


Misaki
(smirk)
“Gynophobia isn’t even real. Maybe you should learn to take a joke, seeing as your condition is one.” 

Kosuke
(sad/crying)
“Haru-chan…?”

I do not like this fight, and Kosuke seems upset. I do not know why Misaki is being so cruel to him. I sigh.

Haruki
“…Well, I mean…it was just a joke, Kosuke.”

Misaki grabs my hand and pulls me close to her. I go along, but I won’t meet Kosuke’s begging gaze. This is not how this afternoon should have gone.

Misaki
(smirk)
“See? Even Haruki-kun agrees with me.”





Kosuke
(sad)
“You’re right. It was just a joke. I’m fine…”
(smile)
“I’m fine, see? Now let’s go have some fun, ok?”

Option 2 (Better path) – Kosuke AND Misaki points (but less M.P. than 1)

Haruki
“That was a little rude, Misaki.” 

Misaki
(surprised or smirk or something)
“Why’s that? It was just a joke.”

Haruki
“Well, clearly you offended him.”

Misaki
(angry or tsun-tsun face)
“Whatever. You idiots just don’t understand my humor.”

I walk over to Kosuke and I put my hand on his shoulder. 


Haruki
“Hey, calm down, OK? Let’s all just have fun shopping.”

Kosuke
(normal)
“Yeah…thanks for standing up for me, Haru-chan.”

I turn back to Misaki

Haruki
“Don’t hold this against me, OK?”

Misaki
(normal?)
“I could never hold anything against you, Haruki-kun.”

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Because you’re in love with him.”

Misaki
(angry)
“I am not in love with him, you idiot!”

She looks for a moment like she’s going to slap him, but we all end up laughing instead. I think I handled this situation pretty well, and we all seem to be happy enough. 


TIMELINE MERGE

Haruki
“Alright, let’s put this behind us and have fun shopping, OK?”

They both nod their agreement. We move from stand to stand, trying to take in as much as possible. We each buy yakitori and snack on it as we look at jewelry and hair accessories. Misaki buys a lime green bow with a cat face as the center. Kosuke buys matching pink bows when Misaki is distracted by necklaces and he thinks I am not looking. I wonder if they are for him; I do not think he has a girlfriend, with his gynophobia. Next, Kosuke and Misaki wander over to a stand selling phone cases, and I walk over to the stuffed animals. 
(Kosuke and Misaki leave screen)
I am admiring a giraffe when a running man bumps into me. Struggling to maintain my balance, I run into another person looking at stuffed animals. 

I turn to face her. She does not look like the kind of person who would be looking at stuffed animals, and yet she is staring intently at a small chartreuse bunny. Her hair is red and black, and round green glasses obscure her face. Clutched in her hands is a book decorated with a star. No, it is not a star…a pentagram. 

(Yuuki Akuma is now on screen. She will be referred to as “???”)


???
(normal)
“You ran into me.”

I am taken aback by how deadpan her tone is. She says it as if she’s reading from a manual on how to operate agricultural irrigation. 

Haruki
“Sorry! It was an accident, I didn’t mean to…”

???
(evil smile)
“I’m going to lay a curse on you for that! I was talking to usa-chan and you interrupted me.”

She flips open her book and begins chanting words I do not recognize or understand.

???
(evil smile)
“Reddam tibi…lepus diabolus…interno cruentamque! Cruentis ab oculis tuis! MORS!!!”

She screams the last word of her ‘curse’ so loudly that it attracts the attention of everyone in the square, including Kosuke and Misaki who rush to my side. 


???
(happy smile)
“That was fun, I love cursing people! Good luck with what time you have left!”

She closes her pentagram book and gives a short wave. Giggling, she pays for the stuffed bunny and skips away with it under one arm and the book under the other. 

(Yuuki Akuma is off screen. She is replaced by Kosuke and Misaki)

Kosuke
(surprised)
“What was that all about!?!”

Misaki
(normal)
“Yeah, who was that girl?”
(yandere)
“Your secret girlfriend?”

Kosuke
(annoyed)
“Misaki…he’s been in Maura for two days, one of which he spent entirely with us. Plus she screamed ‘Mors’. That means ‘death’!”

Haruki
“How do you know that, Kosuke-kun?”
Kosuke
(Happy)
“It was Latin! I recognize mors from Yuta-kun’s dojinshi. It was inscribed over the entrance to the headquarters of the Teke Teke coven.”

I shudder at the mention of Teke Teke, that legend has always freaked me out. 

Misaki
(tsun-tsun)
“She sounds pretty pissed then, what’d you do?”

Haruki
“Hey! Who says that I did something!?”

Misaki
(tsun-tsun)
“You probably did some stupid thing to get her pissed enough to scream death at you in Latin.”

Haruki
“It wasn’t my fault! This man ran into me so I bumped into her and she laid a curse on me!”

Kosuke
(smirk)
“A curse?”
Haruki
“Well…I mean…she opened her book and started muttering in latin…”

Misaki
(unimpressed/smirk)
“Sounds like some kind of pathetic chuunibyo to me.”

I laugh at the mention of chuunibyos, I have not heard anyone use that term since grade school. 

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Yeah, she’s totally the evil eye chuunibyo type. I wouldn’t worry about her little ‘curse’!” 

Haruki
“I wasn’t worried, just surprised.”

Kosuke and Misaki exchange a glance and shrug. My encounter with the strange girl over, we resume shopping. We stop at a stand selling Vocaloid merchandise. Kosuke buys chibi figures of Rin and Len Kagamine, and he buys me a chibi figure of Megurine Luka. Before I can stop her, Misaki buys me a chibi figure of Gumi, asserting that if Kosuke can buy me a figure she should be able to as well. I feel a little guilty letting them buy these gifts for me, but they insist that they are happy to do so. Finally, we stop at Ashiteru Hon, the only place in the market that we have not spent time at yet. 

There is one other customer at the cart when we arrive. She has a childlike face, with enormous pigtails sprouting from each side of her head. She is talking to the bookseller. 

(Momoko Kawai is on screen. She is ??? or ???? for the time being)

???
(normal)
“Umm….hmmm…I’ll take Titus Andronicus, The Iliad, The Silmarillion, and…umm…Finnegan’s Wake. Tehe, that’s four books~!”

She breaks into childish giggles and I seriously wonder if she can comprehend even a sentence from even one of the books she selected. Even so, she pays for the books and takes all four of them. When she turns to leave the stand, she notices us and giggles again.

???
(Normal)
“Oh, Hi~!”

For someone who I have never met before, she’s surprisingly friendly. I guess she does not just look childish, she has the practical intelligence of one.

Haruki
“Hello.”



???
(Normal)
“Tehe, I love books~! Do you love books too?”

Haruki
“Um, yes, I do.”

Her entire face lights up, and she begins to bounce up and down excitedly.

???
(happy)
“Yay~! Book friends~!”

She giggles excitedly and performs a childish curtsy. 

???
(Happy)
“My name is Momoko Kawai~!”

(From now on, she will be referred to in-game as Momoko Kawai)

Haruki
“Kawaii? As in ‘cute’?”


Momoko
(happy or giggly face or something like that)
“Nuh-uh! Only one i~! K-A-W-A-I! But I am cute, though, tehe!”

She breaks into another set of childish giggles and twirls around. I exchange a glance with Misaki and Kosuke, both of whom seem as confused as me.

Haruki
“Um…nice to meet you, Momoko. I am Haruki Nishihara.” 

Momoko
(happy)
“Nice to meet you, Haru-chan~! We’re going to be best, best, bestest friends~! We need to meet really, really soon, OK?”
(sad)
“Or I’ll be really sad, OK~!? And me being sad is not OK!”

Before I can say anything she giggles again, curtsies and runs away with the books in her arms. 

(Momoko leaves the screen and is replaced by Misaki and Kosuke)

Misaki
(some kinda weird expression that reads as WTF. Not sure which)
“What is with the people here today?” 

Haruki
“The residents of this place seem pretty strange…”

Kosuke
(smirk)
“I told you you’d have fun this summer!” 

Kosuke laughs, and we resume shopping. At Ashiteru Hon, I purchase a copy of Kokoro and Battle Royale. Kosuke purchases The Phantom of the Opera. Misaki does not purchase a book, but forces Kosuke to promise that he will share Phantom with him. 

After we purchase our books, we leave the market. Kosuke and Misaki take me on a quick tour around Maura, showing me a few other places such as the hospital, Ms. Kasai’s workplace, the athletics center, the library and the theater. By the time we begin to head home, it is already beginning to get dark. 

(ext. Kasai house. Night.)

Kosuke
(normal)
“Wow, it got late pretty quickly…mom and dad are gonna be pissed.” 

Misaki
(smile)
“It’s worth it for a fun afternoon with Haruki-kun!” 

Haruki
“Yeah, I had fun today too!”

We enter the Kasai household, and we find Mr. and Ms. Kasai waiting for us.

(Int. Kasai House)

(Mr. and Ms. Kasai are on the screen)

Ms. Kasai
(normal)
“You three are late!”

Mr. Kasai
(stern)
“It’s practically time to eat.”

Ms. Kasai
(smile)
“Did you have a good day out, Haru-chan?”

Haruki
“Yes, Ms. Kasai! Sorry for being out so late, there was so much to do and see.”


Mr. Kasai
(smile)
“It’s alright, you said you would be late! Dinner’s about to be served, so just drop your stuff in your room and then we can eat.”

I nod, and Misaki, Kosuke and I go to our rooms. I place the Luka and Gumi figures on my desk, and the books on my bookshelf. They add more character to my room. 

Returning to the dining room, we eat ochazuke and somen noodles. We discuss my first day at work, primarily, with both Mr. and Ms. Kasai inquiring about my experiences so far in Maura. I talk about Momoko and the chuunibyo girl. Both Mr. and Ms. Kasai laugh, and Kosuke and Misaki add supplemental details. 

When dinner is over, Misaki, Kosuke and I move into the living room. A board game is lying out, Shadow Hunters. 

(Ms. Kasai only)

Ms. Kasai
(smile)
“I figured it might be fun to play a game together tonight. I’m not sure what game you’d prefer, but I know Kosuke and Misaki like Shadow Hunters. Have you ever played it?”

Haruki
“It’s one of my favorites.”

Back in high school, I had been part of a club that hosted Shadow Hunters tournaments. I had often participated.

Ms. Kasai
(happy)
“Great! May Mr. Kasai and I join you?”

Haruki
“Sure, it’s more fun with more people!”

We get out the game, and Misaki and Kosuke help me set it up. Once the board is laid out, we choose our colors. I take green, and Kosuke takes purple. Misaki takes yellow. Mr. Kasai takes red and Ms. Kasai takes blue. 

The pieces placed on the HP path, the character cards are shuffled and distributed. I discreetly look at mine. Emi, Hunter Class, Teleport ability. 10 HP. Win conditions: All Shadow Class players are dead. 

I glance up at the faces of Misaki, Kosuke and their parents. I try to read their faces, but I cannot manage to determine what card they have been given, or even what faction they are a part of. 

The game begins, me immediately starting at a disadvantage as I have my turn last. As the turns progress, slowly the identities of the other players become clear to me. Ms. Kasai got Franklin, she uses his lightning ability on Kosuke during the second turn. During the next turn, I learn that Kosuke is Allie. He uses her “mother’s love” ability to heal his nearly depleted HP. Turn after turn, however, Misaki and Mr. Kasai’s characters remain secret. As does mine.

Through the Hermit’s Cabin, I learn that Mr. Kasai at least is almost certainly Shadow Class. In another turn, I realize that he is using the “deceit” ability to dodge the Hermit’s Cabin cards. This means he has to be Unknown. I’ll have to kill him if I’m going to win the game. 

More turns pass. Kosuke is the first out of the game, Allie being killed by Misaki’s player. I think she uses the “suck blood” ability when she kills him, but I cannot be sure. 

Finally, I decide it’s time to take real action. I am at risk for an attack by Misaki, but out of range for Mr. and Ms. Kasai. I can teleport to a different area, but it will expose me as Emi. I look over the board, trying to decide what to do.

1.	Teleport (Win, points to Misaki and Kosuke)
2.	Take a gamble with the dice roll (you lose. No points)

Option 1

I decide that teleporting myself out of danger will ultimately benefit me more, so I do so. 

Misaki
(smirk)
“Now I know who you are. You’re Emi.”

I do not really see the point in denying it. Not once I’ve used her exclusive special ability. 


Haruki
“Yeah, I am. And, if I observed your attack on Kosuke properly…you’re Vampire.”

Misaki
(horrified or something)
“What!? How…!?”

Haruki
“You healed two HP after attacking him…that’s Suck Blood. The exclusive power of Vampire. At any rate, now you know my character.”

I move my teleported piece into the Weird Woods area, and I deal two HP of damage to Misaki. In the next turn, Ms. Kasai also attacks Misaki. Franklin is also hunter class. Misaki and Mr. Kasai team up against Ms. Kasai, and Franklin is killed and removed from the game. 

I beat Misaki in the next turn, getting a lucky dice roll and eliminating her remaining HP. Only Mr. Kasai and I remain after that. Unknown vs Emi. Although Unknown has the raw advantage in HP points, Mr. Kasai is only at about half-health due to an attack by Ms. Kasai in an earlier turn. I, however, still have full HP. 

In only two more turns, I win. I use teleport once more to get out of his range, landing in the cemetery. I damage him with the black card awarded by the area, taking away most of his HP. He must be desperate, because he attacks me. He rolls an unlucky number, however, and I take only two HP points of damage. In the next turn, he is killed. 

Emi’s victory conditions fulfilled, I become the winner.
(Mr. and Ms. Kasai)

Mr. Kasai
(surprised)
“That was extremely impressive!”

Ms. Kasai
(normal)
“You said this game was one of your favorites? You’re clearly very good at it, Haru-chan.” 

(Misaki and Kosuke on screen)

Kosuke
(awed/happy)
“Wow, Haru-chan, that was amazing! I can’t believe I died so quickly.  I definitely want to get better. So you should be my teacher! We can have one-on-one Shadow Hunters teaching sessions every night!”

Misaki
(angry)
“Hey! I lost too! I want Haruki-kun to teach me. He likes me more anyway, he can teach me in my room every night!”

They are both glaring at each other and look like they’re ready to have a fist fight over who gets to have private lessons with me.

Haruki
“I could always just teach both of you…”

They immediately stop exchanging death glares.

Misaki
(annoyed)
“Oh. Right. Yeah. Why didn’t I think of that?”

Kosuke
(disappointed type face?)
“Yeah, true, that’ll be fun. I guess.”

I laugh a little to myself. Of course the entire thing was just a scheme to spend more time with me. These two are unbelievable. 

OPTION 2 

I decide that exposing my character’s identity at this point would be foolish, so I roll the dice. It is a decent roll, but it puts me right in the range of Misaki’s piece. I attack, but my roll is so-so and she only loses 4 HP. She turns around and attacks me on the next turn, taking away almost all of my HP and healing away half of her damage. 

I furrow my brow, not teleporting may have been a mistake. Sure enough, I am dead after Mr. Kasai’s turn. 

The game progresses quickly after that, Misaki and Mr. Kasai teaming up to defeat Ms. Kasai. Seeing as Misaki and Mr. Kasai are the Vampire and Unknown, they win the game. Their victory conditions described that they would win if all the hunters were dead. Franklin and Emi were the only hunters in the game. 

(Misaki on screen)

Misaki
(smirk)
“Looks like I beat you, Haruki-kun!”

Haruki
“I guess I played it wrong.” 

Misaki
(smirk)
“Yeah, well, it cost you! Guess I’m just better than you!” 

I cross my arms and roll my eyes but then I laugh. It was a fun night, even if I lost. 

TIMELINE MERGE

(Ms. Kasai on screen)



Ms. Kasai
(normal)
“It’s gotten rather late. You three need to get to bed in order to be ready for work tomorrow.” 

I yawn. She has a point, and I am tired. 

Haruki
“Goodnight, everyone!”

Everyone says goodnight, and I go to my room. 

(INT. Haruki’s Room)

In my room, I take a manga book off my nightstand and I begin to read it. I am only a few pages in before I fall asleep. 

(scene goes black)

The next morning, only a single voice greets me in the darkness. 

Misaki
“Wake up, Harukiiiiiiiiii~! I’m wearing my cute uniform again~!”

I open my eyes, and sit up in my bed. 

(scene lights up on Misaki.)

Misaki is sitting on my bed, her maid uniform on.

Haruki
“Just you this morning?”

Misaki
(annoyed)
“You wake up with a cute girl in a maid uniform sitting on your bed, and that’s your response!?!”

Haruki
“What was my response supposed to be?”

Misaki
(annoyed)
“I don’t know!  Maybe something about how pretty I am? Aren’t guys supposed to flirt with pretty girls sitting on their beds!?!”

Haruki
“Do you want me to be flirting with you?”

Misaki
(angry)
“No, of course not, you idiot! I’m just saying that you should be.” 
She seems to be getting pretty upset about this. I notice now that my desk is pushed up against my door to prevent it from being opened. 

Haruki
“Umm…Misaki-chan…why is my desk up against the door?”

She quickly turns pink. 

Misaki
(blush)
“No reason!”

Suddenly, there’s a violent pounding on the door. I hear Kosuke’s voice emanating from the other side. 

(KOSUKE IS NOT ON SCREEN)

Kosuke
“Open this door right now, Misaki!!! You can’t lock me out of Haru-chan’s room!” 

Haruki
“Did you…barricade Kosuke-kun out of my room?” 

This sibling rivalry may have gone a little too far.


Misaki
(yandere face or blush)
“I wanted to be alone with you! So we could do something I’ve wanted to do since we were kids…”

She leans in, and her lips are almost touching mine. 

Seconds before our lips meet however, my door is shoved with such a force that it moves my desk. Kosuke bursts through the door.

(Kosuke on screen. Uniform probably, or sleepwear) 

Kosuke
(angry)
“OH HELL NO!”

Kosuke leaps across my bed, falling between us. 

Kosuke
(angry)
“There’s no way you’re going to kiss Haru-chan!!!”

Misaki
(Angry)
“Why not!?!”

Kosuke
(blush)
“Because…because…”
(angry)
“Because I said so!”

Misaki
(angry)
“Well you got this close to kissing him yesterday! I needed to kiss him first!” 

Kosuke
(angry)
“So you were going to kiss him! You ARE in love with him!”

Misaki
(angry blush or tsun-tsun)
“N-no! I am not in love with him, you idiot! I…uh…I just…WELL YOU WANTED TO KISS HIM TOO!”

I notice that they have begun to talk about me as if I am not in the room. I can also feel myself blushing. Quickly, I clear my throat.

SFX THROAT CLEARING

Immediately, they look embarrassed. 

(Kosuke and Misaki faces both blush)

They both get up from my bed. 

Misaki
(blush)
“Right, um, I was just here to wake you up, so…yeah. Get ready for work.”

They both leave my room very quickly, side by side. 

(Kosuke and Misaki leave the screen)

Trying not to think about what just happened, I get out of bed and dress quickly. I am seriously reconsidering if my living here was smart for any of us. So far it just seems to be causing Kosuke and Misaki to fight all the time. Although, they did fight a lot as kids. Nothing’s changed, I guess.

Ensuring that my uniform is on me properly, I adjust my hair before leaving my room.

(INT. KASAI HOUSE DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM)

Once again, Misaki and Kosuke are eating breakfast quietly. Today, it’s miso soup and steamed rice. Neither of them seems to want to discuss what just happened, and Misaki leaves the table as soon as I sit down. 

When Kosuke and I are finished eating, the three of us leave together. We say goodbye to Mr. Kasai and he gives us our lunch. Today, he made us bento boxes. Mine is designed to look like Pikachu. 

Today, we run to work. The scene in my bedroom took longer than Misaki had intended, and now we are once again late. We arrive in Ganbatte one minute later than we probably should have. Gumi-chan, Yuta, Kokona, Sora and Riku are already there. Gumi-chan and Sora both go into the kitchen, and Kokona and Yuta handle the counter again today. Riku just looks at us, shaking his head with his hands on his hips. 

(INT. GANBATTE)

(Riku is on screen)

Riku
(annoyed)
“Late…!? Again!?! This time…this time YOU’RE FIRED!”

I look around worriedly, but Misaki and Kosuke merely start laughing.

Kosuke
(laughing or happy or something like that)
“Uh-huh, sure! Nice joke, Riku-san.”




Riku
(smile)
“You know, one of these days I’m not going to be joking. Between the lateness and the fires…You two are really awful employees, you know? 

Kosuke
(smirk)
“And yet, you don’t ever fire us! Admit it, it’s because we’re so amazing and adorable.” 

Riku
(smirk)
“Ooooooh, of course~! What other reason could I have for keeping either of you around?”

He rolls his eyes and laughs.

Riku
(normal)
“Kosuke, you’ve got the counter again. Misaki, you take the kitchens. Haruki, I think we’ll try your skill with cooking today. So, in the kitchens with Misaki. How does that sound?” 

Kosuke seems horrified of the notion of me and Misaki spending time together after what happened this morning. 

(Kosuke’s face goes horrified or an expression like that)

Riku
(skeptical)
“Is something the matter Kosuke? What, have you had his cooking? Is it like Misaki’s? PLEASE tell me he’s not another arsonist.”

(Misaki on screen)

Misaki
(angry)
“I’m not an arsonist!!!”

Riku
(smirk)
“The fire department begs to disagree.” 

Misaki
(angry)
“Whatever, it was just sixteen little fires…no big deal.” 

I start laughing, and so does Riku. Misaki is still pouting, however, and Kosuke is too horrified for any vocalization.




Riku
(normal)
“You’re better at cooking than her, right?”

In truth, I have not cooked much in my life. I have no idea. 

Haruki
“Not sure.”

Riku
(laugh or happy)
“That’s fine, I’m sure you’ll be great. It’s difficult to be worse than Misaki-chan~!”

Misaki
(angry)
“HEY!!!!”

Riku
(smile)
“I’m kidding, I’m kidding! …mostly. I mean, your food is really good half the time…it’s just the other half that almost burns the café down.”

Misaki
(tsun-tsun)
“Whatever, it’s a learning process.”
Riku laughs and rolls his eyes. 

Riku
“Good luck, Haruki, don’t get too charred.”

Laughing, Riku walks back over to the counter, taking Kosuke with him. 

(Riku off screen. If Kosuke was on the screen (he was replaced by Misaki, right??) he’s gone too. Misaki is the only character left on the screen.) 

Misaki
(yandere)
“So, Haruki-kun, looks like it’ll just be you and me today.”

Haruki
“Well, us and Gumi-chan and Sora-kun.” 

Misaki
(annoyed)
“True. True.” 
(smile)
“But I’ll be teaching you to cook! So I’ll be the only one in that kitchen that matters.”
(yandere)
“Just you…and me. Call me Misaki-sama~!”

Haruki
“Um, wouldn’t Misaki-sensei be more appropriate?” 

Misaki
(annoyed)
“That’s a little impersonal, Haruki-kun!”

Haruki
“Sorry, Misaki-sama.”

Misaki
(blush)
“You called me sama!”

Haruki
“I figured I might as well, if it was so important to you.”

I shrug, but she seems upset by my comment. 

Misaki
(tsun-tsun)
“Don’t be stupid! I was just joking, you’re the one who’s making it a big deal.” 

Haruki
“Um…ok. If you say so.” 
I glance back at the counter, Riku is staring at us. So is Kosuke, although Kokona appears to be attempting to calm him down. Yuta, unsupervised, seems to once again be peddling his dojinshi. 

Misaki
(normal)
“We should probably get to work, or Riku-senpai might yell at us.” 

Haruki
“Oh, yeah, you’re right.”

Misaki grabs my hand, and I let her take it. I am not sure if I should do that. I see Kosuke stare at our interlocked hands. His eyes are almost venomous. 

(INT. KITCHEN)

We enter the kitchen together, and Misaki quickly shows me around. She shows me where we keep the ingredients and the plates and silverware. She quickly explains each of the appliances, although most are standard things such as ovens or refrigerators. Just like what you would see in a kitchen in someone’s home. Only larger, and more professional looking. 

Sora is taking something out of one of the ovens, and Gumi-chan is rolling some dough on a counter. They both wave to Misaki and me before returning to work. 

Misaki
(normal)
“So, what should I teach you first?”

Haruki
“Well, you know the most about cooking…”

Misaki
(smile)
“Let’s make taiyaki! That’s a pretty easy food to start with!”

Haruki
“Ok, sounds like a good idea!”

We move over to a grill with an adjacent counter. Misaki gathers the ingredients, and Gumi-chan comes over with the bowls and whisks. 

Megumi
(normal)
? Here you go~! ? 

She sings it, placing the tools on the counter with dramatic flair before bouncing away to make dango. 

Misaki spreads the ingredients out on the counter and stands next to me. 

Misaki
(normal)
“So, do you know the first step?”
Haruki
“I have to…um…make batter, right?”

Misaki
(smile)
“Yes! Good job, Haruki-kun! See, you already know what you’re doing~!”

Haruki
“I think you’re being a little patronizing, Misaki-sensei…”

Misaki
(angry)
“HEY! I told you not to call me that!” 

I laugh.

Haruki
“Then don’t talk to me like I’m an elementary school student!”

Misaki
(smile)
“Fine, deal! Now just make the batter already, OK?”

I pour the ingredients to the batter into the mixing bowl, and I begin to whisk it. I am whisking gently, being careful. 

Misaki
(annoyed)
“No, no, no, no, no! You’re doing it ALL wrong!”

I stare down at the half-made batter.

Haruki
“What!?!”

Misaki
(smile maybe? Or angry. Undecided which one)
“You have to mean it, Haruki-kun! You’re barely moving, it’ll take forever for the batter to mix at this rate!” 

Haruki
“Oh…I didn’t realize…”

Misaki
(smile or yandere)
“Here, let me help you!”

She positions herself behind me, so close that I can feel her breath on my neck. It’s warm, and makes my skin tingle. She places her hand over my whisk hand, and together we whisk the batter until it has the desired consistency. 

Reluctantly, she draws her hand away. I can tell that she would rather stay this way.

Misaki
(blush)
“Just like that…Haruki-kun.”

I set down the bowl of batter.

Haruki
“So, what next?”

Misaki
(normal)
“Oh…um, you need to pour the batter into the taiyaki mold next, and then set it on the grill. Like a pancake. Then apply the filling before putting the two halves together.”

I nod, and I follow her instructions. I have enough batter for five taiyaki, and soon five golden-brown fish shaped pastries sit on the counter. Misaki picks one up. She examines it for burns, but does not find any.

Misaki
 (smile)
“Wow, Haruki-kun. No fire, and no burns…pretty impressive.”

Haruki
“Maybe you should see how it tastes?”

Misaki
(tsun-tsun)
“As if! Don’t be an idiot! If this is really bad, the only one who’s getting food poisoning from it is you.”
(smile)
“Open up, Haru-tan!”

I roll my eyes at the use of –tan. Now she’s demoted me from elementary school student to baby. Even so, I open my mouth. Misaki leans forward, placing the head of the fish cake in my mouth. I bite down. It tastes surprisingly good, and I take it from her to finish it. 

Haruki
“Wow…it’s really good!”

Misaki
(normal)
“Is it?”

She breaks off part of the taiyaki that remains in my hand and pops it into her mouth. 

Misaki
(happy)
“Oh my God, Haruki! You’re really good at making taiyaki!”

I feel myself blush.
Haruki
“Oh, I’m sure it was just your whisking!”

Misaki
(happy)
“No way! This was all you, Haruki-kun! You’re a natural!”

I smile and look down at my feet. 

Haruki
“Thank you, Misaki-chan.” 

Misaki
(smile)
“I’m just telling you the truth, Haruki-kun!”

I smile widely, and I make a few more batches of taiyaki, Misaki by my side and helping as needed. She seems happy. Eventually, however, Gumi-chan walks over to us. 

(Megumi on screen)

Megumi
(smile)
“Misaki-chan, do you mind if I teach Haruki-kun about making dango now?” 

Misaki gives me a long look and then gives Gumi-chan a long look.

Misaki
(yandere)
“Sure, Gumi-chan…but don’t try anything.”

I realize only now that Misaki is currently holding a kitchen knife. Very, very, very tightly. 

Megumi
(surprised)
“Anything…? I don’t understand.”

Misaki
(yandere)
“That goes for you too, Haruki-kun…”

Haruki
“…Ok?”

Misaki returns to work on taiyaki and begins also making daifuku and anpan while Gumi-chan brings me over to the dango station. 

(Misaki off screen)


Megumi
(normal)
“Do you know how to make dango?” 

Haruki
“Kind of…?”

Megumi
(happy)
“Well, it’s fine, I’ll teach you!”

She grabs three bowls and the ingredients. 

Megumi
(happy)
“? Step onnnnnne~!! ? You have to make the dough and add the three falvors!! Do you know how to do that?”

Haruki
“Yes!” 

Megumi
(happy)
“Yay~! Then onto… ? Step twwwwwwwwwwo~! ? you put the dango into boiling water for about two minutes to cook them. And finally…. ?Step threeeeeee~!!!! ? skewer and serve! Do you have all that?” 

It seems simple enough, although I probably could have done without all of Gumi-chan’s singing. She’s pretty loud, and Misaki keeps glaring over at us. 

Haruki
“Yes, I think I’ve got it!” 

Megumi
(happy)
“Yay!!! Then ? Let’s…make…dangooooo~! ?” 

She sets up six bowls and we both begin working. Dango is quick, producing a fairly large quantity with little effort. As I work, I notice that Gumi-chan is singing to herself. 

Megumi
(distracted or singing)
“? It’s fop…finest in the shop! And we have some shepherd’s pie peppered with ACTUAL shepherd on top! And I’ve just begun, have a politician so oily it’s served with a doily, have one! ?”

Haruki
“What’s that you’re singing?”

I pick up one of the dango skewers from my first batch and I begin to eat it. 


Megumi
(normal)
“It’s from an American musical set in London. It’s called Sweeney Todd, and it’s about a serial murderer barber. This song is called “A Little Priest” and it’s about how the pie shop owner is going to cut up the corpses of his murder victims to sell as meat pies. I often sing it when I’m cooking.” 

Haruki
“Oh, um, that’s…nice.” 

Megumi
(excited/happy)
“Isn’t it!?! I was in a production of it once at my school! I was Ms. Lovett, the pie shop woman!”

Haruki
“The one who sold human meat pies?”

Megumi
(happy)
“Mhm~!”

Haruki
“Maybe we shouldn’t trust you around the anpan, then!”

I start to laugh, but Gumi-chan does not seem to get the joke. 

Megumi
(confused)
“It’s…acting. I’m a very good actress, Haruki-kun. In fact, once a talent scout told me that I really had potential and that I should be in movies!”
(Sad)
 “When I went to his studio, though…it was just an abandoned building. So…I guess he was a liar.”

Gumi-chan looks at the ground, and I wonder how I should comfort her. I almost reach out my hand to her, but I see Misaki out of the corner of my eye. She is staring at me. Before I can decide what to do, however, Gumi-chan leaps up with far too much dramatic flair for a kitchen.

Megumi
(happy)
“But I’m not going to give up! Just because I got one rejection, it doesn’t mean I have to lie down and die! I’m going to be in movies one day, just you wait! You’ll see me at Kokuritsu Gekijo~! My face will be on movie posters! Just you wait, Gumi-chan’s gonna be on billboards in Tokyo!” 

She giggles. 

Megumi
(happy)
“Promise to come to my shows, OK~!?”

I laugh a little. 

Haruki
“Sure!”

She seems satisfied with this answer, and we go back to cooking. Gumi-chan begins to sing to herself again, this time about having “the worst pies in London”. We cook for about two hours and the three teach me how to make as many dishes as possible. Eventually, I wind up with Sora making anpan. 

(Sora replaces Megumi on screen)

Sora
(lecturing)
“In truth, I find all these cooking procedures to be pretty outdated. If it were up to me, I’d create robots that could do it! I’ve even got some plans drawn up…not that I’ll let you see them…
(troubled)
“WAIT! I probably shouldn’t have admitted that! Now you’ll break into my office at night when I’m sleeping…”

Haruki
“I promise I won’t…”

Sora
(angry)
“That’s what they ALL say!!!”
(horrified)
“And wait, I just admitted that I sleep at night! Now you know the optimal time to rob me!”
Haruki
“I’m pretty sure that most people sleep at night…”

Sora
(lecturing)
“Yuta doesn’t sleep at night.”

Haruki
“But he works here during the day…?”

Sora
(lecturing)
“Correct, he never sleeps!”

Haruki
“I’m pretty sure that’s impossible…?”

Sora
(lecturing)
“Annnyways, even if you did want to rob me, you’d never figure out my address. Which is, of course…DAMMIT!”
(horrified)
“You almost got me to reveal where all my plans are stored! Well there and in the flashdrive hanging around my neck.”
(angry)
“DAMMIT!! Forget I said that!”
He runs his hands angrily through his hair and withdraws a rolled up copy of Nikkei Magazine from his pocket. He proceeds to bash himself over the head with it several times while talking to himself. 

Sora
(upset)
“Idiot! Idiot! Don’t reveal the locations of your plans! IDIOT! Don’t you want to be a billionaire???” 

I glance over at Misaki and Gumi-chan. Both are at separate cooking stations. Neither is paying Sora any attention. Misaki is stirring something on the stove. I guess this is a normal thing for Sora to do. These people have a pretty warped sense of “normal”. A few seconds later, Sora stops. He smooths his hair and returns Nikkei to his pocket as if none of this ever happened.

Haruki
“So…anyway. I feel like the robots would be cool and all but wouldn’t they eliminate the need for workers like us?”

Sora
(lecturing)
“Of course they would~! That’s their whole purpose! Didn’t I explain it clearly?”

Haruki
“But then…why would you want that?”



Sora
(lecturing)
“In the name of efficiency of course!”
(devious)
“Plus, if I’m a billionaire robotics mogul, who needs a small-time café job? Ooh, and while I’m at it, I should create an AI to replace counter workers~!”

I snicker.

Haruki
“And then Skynet, right?”

Sora
(confused)
“Skynet?”
 
Haruki
“From Terminator?”

Sora
(normal)
“Oh…that American movie? I’ve never seen it…”

Haruki
“Oh, well, never mind then…”

Suddenly, an alarm sounds.

SFX FIRE ALARM

Sora and I wheel around, but already I smell the smoke. When we turn around, Misaki is standing in front of a large stove fire, fire extinguisher in hand. 

(CG art screen of Misaki and the fire? Feels dramatic…)

(Misaki on screen)

Misaki
(angry)
“Damn…damn…DAMMIT! It was only a few minutes extra and some variation on the recipe…I thought it would go well!!!” 

Misaki struggles with the heavy fire extinguisher. She sprays it, but ends up missing and hitting the wall, making the mess worse. 

A second later, Riku burst into the kitchen, drawn by the loud sirens. 

(Riku on screen)

Riku
(horrified)
“Seventeen, Misaki-chan!?! Seventeen!?!” 
Riku wrenches the fire extinguisher out of Misaki’s hands and quickly puts of the fire. 

SFX FIRE ALARM OVER

Misaki
(blush)
“Sorry, Riku-senpai, it was…I don’t know, the fire just happened!”

Riku rolls his eyes.

Riku
(annoyed)
“What was it this time?”

Misaki
(blush)
“Well, I was cooking and experimenting…I guess I left it on for too long?” 

Riku gives a long sigh. 

Riku
(defeated)
“Well, that’s number seventeen. I seriously hope that the fire department wasn’t called this time.”

Misaki
(smirk)
“Aren’t they automatically called every time the alarm goes off?”

Riku
(annoyed)
“Dammit, you’re right. Well now I’ll have to explain this to them!” 
(defeated)
“Why don’t you all just clean this up and take your lunch break, OK?”

Without waiting for a response, Riku sulks out of the kitchen. Gumi-chan, Sora, Misaki and I exchange a look. A moment later Sora has handed us all dishcloths and we are wiping the ash, soot and extinguisher fluid off the stove and walls. When we are done, we dispose of the charred food. 

(Megumi the only one on screen)

Megumi
(excited)
“Lunch time, ? Lunch timeeee~! ?”

Gumi-chan skips over to a few chairs in the corner. She slips in earbuds and pulls a bento box and strawberry ramune out of her bag. She hums to her music and gently bobs her head as she eats and drinks.
Walking over to the chair next to Gumi-chan, Sora sits down. Without speaking to her he takes out his lunch. Sora is eating a cup of instant noodles and a small bottle of water, simple and inexpensive. When his food is all set up, he extracts Nikkei from his pocket, along with two other magazines. American magazines, Bloomberg Businessweek and Forbes. They’re both in English, but he sits down and flips through the pages of Forbes as easily as he would Nikkei. 

(Sora is on screen)

Haruki
“Sora, you read American magazines!?”

Sora
(lecturing)
“Of course I do! All the real businessmen do. Everyone knows that to succeed in business you have to speak both Japanese and English at least! How else are you supposed to succeed at international trade?”

Haruki
“Yes, I guess that makes sense.”

Sora
(happy)
“Of course it does! So I’ve been training myself in American business language ever since I was a child. I know it all. Elasticity! Liaison! Efficiency! Paradigm! Recontextualize! Synergy!”

I do not recognize a few of the words, and I am not entirely sure if all of them are real. 


Haruki
“Wow, Sora-kun, that’s pretty impressive.”

Sora
(happy)
“I know! And one day, my company will be too! Takayama Tech! I suggest you put in your order to buy stock now. I don’t mean to brag, but it’s going to be worth a lot!”

I laugh a little.

Haruki
“Ok, I’ll get right on that!”

Sora laughs a little too, and then takes a bite of his noodles before returning to his magazines. 

Across the room, Misaki is gesturing for me to eat with her. She is sitting in a few chairs by the kitchen door, her bento box on her lap. 

(Sora off screen, Misaki on screen)

Misaki
(normal)
“Hey, Haruki-kun, come sit with me!”

I nod my consent and I walk over to where she is sitting. Sitting down beside her, I too take out my bento box. Taking a large bite out of Pikachu’s head, I smile at Misaki. 

Haruki
“Nice one with that fire earlier~!”

Misaki
(angry)
“Shut up! It was a mistake! It happens!”

Haruki
“Jeez, Misaki-chan, I’m only joking.”

Misaki
(smirk)
“Well, for that idiotic joke, you’re going to have to eat one of my tsukune!”

I open my mouth to speak, and she shoves a tsukune into it. I smile, and chew it. It tastes good, really good.

Haruki
“Was that supposed to be a punishment?”

Misaki shrugs, the smile still on her face. 


Haruki
“You really have a thing for feeding me, don’t you?”

Misaki
(blush)
“What!? No! Shut up! I do not, it’s just that…you’re so much of a baby that sometimes I forget that you can feed yourself!”

I smirk and laugh a little.

Haruki
“If you say so.” 

She rolls her eyes, and we continue eating. A moment later, Kosuke comes through the door with a drink in his hand. The straw is in his mouth, and he’s drinking it. 

(Kosuke on screen)

Kosuke
(normal)
“Hey Haru-chan!”
(happy)
“I just made this drink, you’ve got to try it! It’s a mix of raspberry and melon ramune and it tastes amazing!” 


He stops sipping the drink and holds it out to me. Misaki leaps up, nearly spilling his drink as she slaps it away from my face.

Misaki
(angry)
“No way, no way! There’s no way you can drink that!”

I stare at her.

Haruki
“Why not!?”

Misaki
(angry)
“Because Kosuke was just drinking out of it! If you put your lips on that straw, some of the saliva he left on that straw is going to get in your mouth!”

Haruki
“So? Does Kosuke-kun have a cold or something?”

I still do not understand what he issue is. 

Misaki
(angry)
“So!?!?! So it’s an indirect kiss, you idiot!”

Haruki
“Indirect kiss…?”

I have no idea what she’s talking about. Kosuke is also staring at her with a confused look on his face.

Misaki
(angry)
“Have you NEVER read a manga!?! When a person leaves their spit on an object, such as a straw, and then another person mixes that spit with their own spit, it’s BASICALLY a kiss!”

Haruki
“That doesn’t sound that much like a kiss…”

Misaki
(angry)
“Well, it is! And indirect kiss. And if Haruki’s having an indirect kiss with anyone, he should be drinking from my cup!”

Misaki holds out her drink to me, a half-empty thermos of green tea. 

Kosuke
(angry)
“Hey! Haru-chan should drink my drink, I was just trying to show him what it tastes like! You’re the one who’s trying to turn this into some moé anime!” 
Options
1.	Drink Kosuke’s drink (Kosuke points)
2.	Drink Misaki’s drink (Misaki points)
3.	Drink no one’s drink (Neutral option)

OPTION 1 – Drink Kosuke’s drink

Haruki
“So, raspberry and melon ramune?” 

Kosuke smiles, but Misaki’s mouth falls open in horror at my question.

Kosuke
(smile)
“Yes!”

Haruki
“It sounds good!”

Misaki
(horrified or angry)
“You’re not seriously drinking it are you?”

I take the cup from Kosuke.


Haruki
“Yes, I am!”

Misaki
(angry)
“But you’re KISSING him!!!!”

Haruki
“No I’m not…”

I slip the straw into my mouth. 

Kosuke
(normal)
“It’s good, right?”

Misaki
(angry)
“YOU’RE KISSING HIM!!!!!!!!!!”

I ignore Misaki. It’s kind of funny watching her get bent out of shape like this.

Haruki
“Wow, it does taste really good! Melon and Raspberry?”

Misaki
(angry)
“HOW ARE YOU SO CALM ABOUT THIS!!!!!”

Kosuke
(smile)
“Yeah! Who’d have known?”

Misaki
(angry)
“YOU LITERALLY JUST KISSED!!!!!”

Haruki
“It’s amazing!”

Misaki
(angry)
“I hate you BOTH!”

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Well, I’ve got to get back to work now! Keep the drink, I can make myself another. Just one more sip though?”

Haruki
“Sure!”
I take the straw out of my mouth. Kosuke leans in and takes the straw. He sips, and purposefully brushes my lips with his as he pulls away from the straw. Misaki is too angry to speak. She looks like she wants to claw our organs out. 

Kosuke
(seductive?)
“Thanks, Haru-chan!”

Kosuke walks out of the kitchen, winking at Misaki as he goes. 
(Kosuke off screen)
Misaki crosses her arms and angrily shovels down the rest of her bento. Rising from her seat, she gives me a death glare. 

Misaki
(Yandere or Tsun Tsun or angry)
“You’re dead to me.” 

She walks away and goes back to cooking. 

Option 2 – Misaki’s drink
Haruki
“Well…I do like green tea.”

Kosuke
(horrified)
“Haru-chan, you’re not SERIOUSLY buying this ‘indirect kiss’ crap are you?”


Haruki
“No way! I just…happen to like green tea.”

Kosuke shakes his head. 

Kosuke
(annoyed)
“You can get green tea any time! This is melon and raspberry ramune mixed! How often do you get that chance!?”

I take Misaki’s thermos.

Haruki
“I just…think that green tea would go better with what I’m eating.”

Misaki
(smirk)
“Maybe he just wants to kiss me and not you!”

I am not sure if indirect kisses are real, but I blush as she says it and I drink the tea. Kosuke shrugs.



Kosuke
(normal)
“Whatever, more for me!”

Kosuke walks out of the kitchen, drinking his ramune. 
(Kosuke off screen)
When he’s gone, Misaki leans in close to me.

Misaki
(blush)
“Did you like the green tea?”

Haruki
“Yeah! Were you really that serious about having an indirect kiss with me?”

Suddenly she sits back hard in her seat.

Misaki
(tsun tsun)
“No way! Don’t be stupid. Kosuke just had a cold last week and I didn’t want you to catch it. That’s all.” 

I shrug as I hand back the thermos. It seems like a contrived excuse, but I’m not going to push the issue. 

Misaki and I finish our lunches, and she rises and heads back to work. 

Option 3 – no one’s drink


Haruki
“Maybe I shouldn’t drink out of anyone’s drink.”

Both of them look at me horrified. 

Kosuke
(horrified)
“Why!?!”

Misaki
(horrified)
“What!!!?”

Haruki
“I don’t know. You guys are all so concerned with ‘indirect kisses’ and whose cup I should drink out of…maybe I just shouldn’t pick a side.”

Kosuke
(annoyed)
“Side? This isn’t a war.”


Misaki
(angry)
“SWITZERLAND!”

Haruki
“I am not Switzerland! I just don’t want…germs.”

Misaki
(angry)
“Germs!?!?!”

I feel my face getting hot. This is uncomfortable.

Haruki
“Well…yeah. When people exchange saliva they exchange germs too, right? I don’t want to catch mono!”

Kosuke nearly drops his cup.

Kosuke
(horrified)
“Who said anything about mono!?!” 

Misaki
(angry)
“Are you imply that we have disease-ridden mouths!?!”

Haruki
“No…it’s just…”

Misaki
(angry)
“So, basically, neither of us is good enough to share an indirect kiss with!?!”

Haruki
“No…it’s just…”

This has gotten out of hand.

Kosuke
(annoyed)
“Wow, and after I came in here to share my drink too! Whatever, more for me!”

Laughing, Kosuke sips his drink and exits the kitchen.
(Kosuke off screen)

Misaki says nothing for the rest of lunch, merely glaring at me icily as she sips her green tea. When she finishes eating, she rises and quickly puts away her food. Shooting me one more look, she goes back to cooking. 

ALL TIMELINES MERGE

After Misaki is gone, I glance around the kitchen. Gumi-chan has finished and she is singing and cooking again. Sora is still reading a magazine. He glances at his watch, frowns and puts away the magazine. 

I should probably get back to work too. I finish my bento box, and I put it away. 

The rest of the day passes quickly. I cook alongside Misaki, Gumi-chan and Sora. Sora constantly mutters to himself about efficiency and production possibilities. Gumi-chan keeps the kitchen filled with music. She seems to favor singing the same song several times in a row, though. By the end of the day, I have learned all the lyrics to “Worst Pies in London”. Misaki is the most joking of all of us, constantly making sarcastic commentary. Gumi-chan laughs along with her, but Sora seems to barely acknowledge her. 

Finally, the work day is over. Before he walks out, Sora walks over to me.

(Sora on screen)

Sora
(suspicious)
“Hey…you’re not going to rob me, are you?”

I roll my eyes. This guy’s just a little too paranoid. 

1.	Have some fun with him (no points)
2.	Brush it off (no points)

Option 1 – Have some fun
I decide that I’m going to have some fun with this. 

Haruki
“I already have!”

Sora
(horrified)
“What!?!?!”

Haruki
“Yup. I lifted your flashdrive when you weren’t looking.”

His eyes widen comically. 

Sora
(horrified)
“Really!?!?!”

He violently grabs at his neck, slamming his hands around for several seconds before locating the drive that still sat around his neck.

Sora
(annoyed)
“That wasn’t funny.”


Haruki
“You’re definitely a little too easy.”

Sora rolls his eyes. 

Sora
(lecturing)
“And just when I thought you’d make a good business partner.”

He stares directly into my eyes. 

Sora
(suspicious or lecturing)
“I’m watching you, Haruki-kun. I’m watching you.” 

Sora places a hand on the flashdrive around his neck and he walks out of the kitchen. 

Option 2 – Nothing
He’s too paranoid even to tease.

Haruki
“I’m not going to rob you, OK?”



Sora
(suspicious)
“Promise?”

I roll my eyes.

Haruki
“I promise.”

Sora smiles. He looks pleased with himself.

Sora
(happy)
“I’ll be keeping my eyes on you, Haruki-kun. You might just be good enough to make business partner!”

Sora waves.

Sora
(normal)
“Bye!”

Sora walks out of the kitchen. 

ALL TIMELINES MERGE. 

(Sora is off screen)

Once Sora is gone, Gumi-chan skips past me, humming to herself.

(Megumi on screen)

Megumi
(smile)
“Thanks you earlier!”

Haruki
“No problem I meant what I said!”

Megumi
(blush)
“You’d better have!”
(smile)
“I expect to see you at my first major show!”

Haruki
“I’ll be there!” 

Gumi-chan smiles and waves at me before slipping in earbuds and skipping out of the kitchen. 

(Megumi off screen)
Once Gumi-chan is gone, Misaki walks over and punches me lightly in the arm.

(Misaki on screen)

Misaki
(smile)
“So, day two of work over!”

I smile.

Haruki
“Yeah!”

Misaki
(smile)
“How do you feel?”

I laugh a little.

Haruki
“Pretty good…maybe a little tired.”

Misaki laughs too.


Misaki
(smile)
“Yeah, that’s to be expected. I remember my and Kosuke’s first week was pretty tiring. It gets better though.”

Haruki
“That’s good!”

Misaki
(smile)
“Yeah!” 

I nod, and we exit the kitchen.

INT. GANBATTE

As soon as we are outside the kitchen, I notice that the other workers have arrived. Yuta, like Gumi-chan and Sora, has already left. I feel a sharp pang in my chest, surprising myself with the level of disappointment I feel at the fact that Kokona is gone and I did not get the chance to speak to her today. Strange. Even as I see this, however, I see Kokona walking by the front windows. She glances inside, sees me, and waves delicately. I wave back, and I smile. She smiles back, and then continues on her way. 

Everyone else besides the next shift gone, Kosuke walks up to Misaki and I.

(Kosuke on screen)

Kosuke
(normal)
“Hey guys! Ready to go home?”

Haruki
“Yeah!”

(Everyone goes off screen)

We leave Ganbatte and enter the streets of Maura.

EXT STREET SCENE MAURA

We decide to go straight home today, I am tired. Despite this, we swing by a shaved ice stand on the way home. Kosuke insists that I have to try it now. He and Misaki fight over who gets to pay for mine. Of course. In the end, I propose the idea that they simply split the cost of it. They fight for a little longer after that but ultimately begrudgingly agree. I get lemon-lime. Misaki buys one that is cherry flavored. Kosuke gets rainbow. 

We eat our shaved ice as we head home. It’s another warm day, and the air is still. When we get to Kosuke and Misaki’s house, we sit on the front porch to finish the shaved ice. 

EXT KASAI HOUSE

(Misaki and Kosuke on screen)

Kosuke
(normal)
“It’s such a beautiful day…”

He stares up at the sky as he absentmindedly puts a spoonful of red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet ice chips in his mouth. 

Haruki
“It is!”

I take another spoonful. I’m more the halfway done with my shaved ice now, I love lemon-lime flavored things. It may be my favorite flavor. 

Misaki
(happy)
“And it will only get better as summer goes on! And hotter.”

Haruki
“Does it get hot here?”

My home village was almost on the other side of Japan. I have no experience with the summers here. 

Misaki and Kosuke merely look at each other and smirk.


Misaki
(smirk)
“Yes! Extremely hot. Like, melt on the pavement hot.”

Haruki
“Wow, that sounds…pleasant.”

Kosuke laughs.

Kosuke
(happy)
“Oh, don’t worry, it’s not so bad. There’s ramune and shaved ice all over Maura during the hottest weeks.”

Misaki
(happy)
“And don’t forget the green tea ice cream!”

Haruki
“Wow, summer here sounds pretty nice!”

Misaki
(happy)
“It is! And it’ll be even more fun with you here with us!”


Kosuke
(normal)
“What were summers like after we left, Haru-chan?”

I think it over. In truth, kind of uneventful. 

Haruki
“Kind of boring, actually. I didn’t really have many friends after you two left. So mostly, I kept to myself. Read and played video games, you know? I mean, I still had Takao-kun and Makoto-chan, but I never really made any new friends. And once the two of them started dating, I didn’t really see either of them much anymore. They just wanted to be alone together…I always felt a little awkward when I was with them.”

Kosuke begins laughing.

Kosuke
(happy)
“Takao and Makoto started dating? I sooo called that!”

Misaki, however, is not impressed by Kosuke’s newfound psychic ability. She stares down at the grass below the porch and eats her cherry shaved ice with a strange look on her face. As if she was just realizing something she had never considered before. 

Misaki
(normal)
“What about you, Haruki-kun? Any girlfriends?”
Haruki
“Me? No. No one ever really expressed interest in me I guess. I guess no one really thought I was attractive. I mean, it’s not like I got love letters in my locker and no one gave me chocolate on festival days…”

I had not realized until now how much this had bothered me. Suddenly I feel very alone. I shove a large spoonful of ice chips into my mouth, hoping to focus instead on the lemon-lime flavor.

Misaki
(blush)
“That can’t possibly be true! You’re amazing Haruki-kun! You’re so interesting, and handsome and…”

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Wow, sis, crushing a little hard on Haru-chan?”

Misaki
(tsun-tsun)
“No way! I’m just pointing out why some other girl might like Haruki-kun!” 

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Alright, I believe you.”

Clearly, he doesn’t. 
We finish our shaved ice in silence and then retreat into the air conditioned confines of the home. 
INT. KOSUKE’S ROOM
Once we are inside, the three of us go up to Kosuke’s room where we spend the remainder of the afternoon watching the full series of Angel Beats! When we finish, we eat dinner with Mr. and Ms. Kasai, and I return to my room for the night. 
INT. HARUKI’S ROOM

Inside my room, I sit on my bed. I am just about to grab my handheld when I suddenly hear a ringing noise. 

SFX PHONE RINGTONE OR SOMETHING?

I realize that it is my phone. I remove it from where it rests in my pocket, and I glance at it. The caller ID reads “Home”. It must be my parents. I tap the green button, and the call begins.

(Art screen of Haruki on the phone to give them something to look at?)

Haruki
“Hello?”

(Note: Neither of Haruki’s parents are ever seen on screen. Neither one shows up on screen.)

Mom
“Hi, Haru-tan!”
Haruki
“Hi, mom!”

Mom
“How are you, sweetheart? Where are you? Did you get to Maura safely?” 

Haruki
“Yeah, mom. I’m actually in Kosuke and Misaki’s house. I realized right after I got here that I didn’t actually have anywhere to stay…”

Mom
“Oh, Haru-tan, I never would have let you go on this trip if I knew you were so unprepared!”

Haruki
“I know, mom.”

That is part of the reason I did not tell her those particular details before departing. 

Mom
“And now, because you didn’t plan, you’re imposing yourself on Kasai-san? That’s just wrong, Haru-tan…”

Haruki
“I’m sorry, mom, but I had no other options and they…”

She cuts me off.

Mom
“Do you need me to send money so you can pay her rent?”

Haruki
“No, it’s fine. They’re happy to have me here, I swear, mom. And I could pay my own rent. I got a job at a café here in town.”

Mom
“Aww, you got a job? That’s amazing Haru-tan!”

Haruki
“Thanks, mom.”

Mom
“Of course, Haru-tan. So, how are the Kasai’s?”

Haruki
“Misaki and Kosuke are as lively and argumentative as ever!”

Mom
“I’ll bet they are, they were such loud and energetic children…”



Haruki
“Yeah. Mr. and Ms. Kasai are good too! Ms. Kasai is working at this medical research company, and Mr. Kasai has a successful bento business!” 

Mom
“That’s great! I’m happy to hear that Mizuki and Kazuhiro are doing well. Give them my love, ok?” 

Haruki
“Yeah, ok, mom.”

Mom
“Would you like to speak to your father…? Oh, wait, I forgot, he’s out right now.”

Even though she says that, I know it’s a lie. I distinctly heard his voice on the other end. No, no, tell him I’m not home. Of course. Of course he would not want to speak to me, he never does. I am surprised, in a way, how much it bothers me. I thought I had gotten used to it by now. I guess not.

Haruki
“Oh, how unfortunate. Next time.” 

Mom
“Right. Yes, of course. Call me back soon, OK, Haru-tan? Or I’ll just call you. Whichever. Be good, ok? Don’t fight with Misaki and Kosuke and be sure to be respectful to Mizuki and Kazuhiro. Bye, sweetheart!”


Haruki
“Bye!”

I hear the tone as the call ends. Upset, I throw my phone at my bed. Not hard enough to break it, of course. I am angry, not senseless. I do know one thing, however. If I had even a shred of homesickness, it is gone. 

Taking my handheld from the desk, I sit down in the corner of my room. 
(ART screen of depressed gaming Haruki? Or nah?)
I do not know why I have chosen to sit in the corner. I feel upset, I guess, and sitting alone in the corner feels like something that an upset person would do. I turn on my handheld, and I begin to play Animal Crossing. There’s mail in my villager’s mailbox. A letter from his father. It makes me want to scream, and I have to close my 3DS for a few seconds to calm down. I breathe in and out. In and out. I do not know why I am so upset. It’s idiotic to me, that I am so upset by this. So he did not want to talk to me. So what!? A girl who I once had a crush on told me that I should not place my self-worth on a person texting me back, or something like that. So, really, if I am following her advice I should not be getting so upset over this. And yet, I am. Why doesn’t he want to talk to me? Why does he always seem so disappointed when he has to? 
My vision is blurring with hot tears now, and I lift up a hand to wipe the tears away. They are not necessary. I reopen my 3DS, and I allow myself to be sucked into the carefree world of anthropomorphic animals and pastel colors. 
At some point a few hours later, I turn off the game and I place it back on my desk. Moving over to my door, I lock it. I have had enough of morning disturbances. My door locked, I set an alarm on my phone and I climb into bed. Seconds after my head hits the pillow, I fall into a fitful sleep. 

SFX TIME PASSING THING 

I wake up after several minutes of the alarm going off. I do not know if the other members of the household can hear it, so I quickly disable it. 

(Lights to bedroom of Haruki)

I glance at my clock. I sit up violently, the alarm has been ringing for much longer than I had originally thought. I now have only five minutes to eat and get dressed. Thankfully, I have no unwanted visitors this morning. 

I leap out of bed and rush across my room, throwing open my closet and throwing on my uniform so quickly that I must set some sort of record. When I’m done, I throw open my door and I practically run into the main area of the house.

INT. KASAI HOUSE

As I suspected they would be, Kosuke and Misaki are already finished with breakfast. They are sitting in the living room, dressed for work. When I enter the room, they stand and walk over to me.

(Kosuke and Misaki on screen)

Kosuke
(smirk)
“So, you overslept, huh?”

Haruki
“Yeah, I guess so!”

Misaki
(yandere)
“And…you locked your room! We couldn’t even get inside to wake you up! I can understand why you’d want to lock out Kosuke-kun, but why wouldn’t you let me in? Don’t you want to be woken up by the kiss of an adorable, available, girl?”

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Creepy much? No wonder he’d lock you out. Although why would you lock me out?”

I merely laugh in response, grabbing a few onigiri from the table a biting into them as I walk towards the front door with Kosuke and Misaki close behind me. I gasp in surprise as my teeth pass through the center of the onigiri triangle. It tastes like raspberry. I pull the food away from my mouth to get a better look at it. It is filled with raspberry filling. And it tastes…amazing. I quickly finish the onigiri I have bitten before moving on to the next one. Mr. Kasai calls out to me as I pass him.

(Mr. Kasai is the only one on screen)

Mr. Kasai
(happy)
“Oh, good morning, Haruki-kun! I see you found my special raspberry onigiri! Actually, this is the first time I’ve made them, are they any good?”

Haruki
“Yes, they’re amazing!”

Mr. Kasai
(happy)
“Thank you! I’ll have to start putting them in some of my bento boxes. I’ll make more of them for you too!” 

Haruki
“Oh, please do!”

He nods, and Kosuke, Misaki and I resume our commute. We’re not quite as late as we’ve been, but we still need to hurry if we’re going to get to work on time.

When we arrive at Ganbatte, we are one minute early. 

INT. GANBATTE

(Riku is on screen)

Riku
(faux-surprised)
“Wow, a whole minute early? To what do I owe the pleasure?”

(Kosuke on screen)

Kosuke
(mocking or smirk)
“Well not to Haru-chan over here!”
He tussles my hair. 

Kosuke
(smirk)
“Little Haru-tan got off to a sleepy start this morning.” 

Riku
(smirk)
“Too much partying last night?”

I would not call it a party by a long shot. 

Haruki
“Yeah…something like that.”

Riku
(normal)
“Yeah, I can tell you got ready quickly. Your hair is sticking up in the back, and your tie is a little askew. And there’s some jam below your lip.”

Haruki
“Oh…is there?”

I am about to reach up and get it, but Kosuke grabs my wrist to stop me.


Kosuke
(happy)
“Allow me! Jam is sticky, and we can’t let your fingers get all sticky!”

Disregarding the status of his own fingers, Kosuke reaches up and removes it with a swipe of his index finger. He then places the finger to his tongue and he licks it.

Kosuke
(happy)
“Mmm, raspberry!”

Next to me, I see Misaki practically leap out of her skin. I snicker to myself, I can practically hear her internally screaming about indirect kisses.

(Misaki replaces Riku)

Misaki
(yandere or tsun-tsun)
“Is something funny, Haruki-kun?”

Haruki
“Um, no, it’s nothing.”

Misaki
(yandere or tsun-tsun)
“Right, well, um, your tie is still askew. Let me get that for you.”
She walks up to me and puts her hands on my tie. She pulls, tightening it to the point that it nearly cuts off my airway.

Haruki
“…Misaki…you…you’re choking me…!”

She suddenly lets go and I loosen it slightly.

Misaki
(yandere or tsun-tsun)
“Oh, am I? Sorry.” 

Honestly? She didn’t sound very sorry. I shrug in response and I slowly focus on regaining my breath.

(Riku replaces both)

Riku
(normal)
“Well that was fun.” 

Haruki
“Loads.”



Riku
(normal)
“Well, let’s see, today I think we’ll have you work the counter, Haruki. Misaki, Kosuke, you’ll both be in the kitchens with Yuta. Haruki, you’ll work with Kokona, Sora and Megumi at the counter today.”

Haruki
“Ok!”

Misaki and Kosuke both look a little put out not to be working with me today. I find it a little hard to feel bad, however, I am happy to be working with Kokona again today. And, perhaps if Misaki and Kosuke are both in the same place away from me it will stop them from fighting over me.

Riku
(happy)
“Alright, let’s get to work, ganbatte!” 

He seems pleased with the potential double meaning of his words. In my opinion, it was a pretty basic wordplay, but I don’t tell him that. I see no reason to. Riku leaves (Riku off screen) and Misaki and Kosuke begrudgingly walk off to the kitchen. I go over to the counter, where Sora and Gumi-chan are taking the orders of customers. Kokona is wiping a smudge off one of the konpeito jars. When I walk over, she smiles at me.

(Kokona on screen)



Kokona
(happy)
“Good morning, Haruki-kun!”

Haruki
“Morning, Kokona-chan!”

Kokona
(concerned)
“Hey, Haruki-kun, did you sleep well last night? You look kinda tired…”

Haruki
“Yeah, I, uh, had an interesting night and got to bed late…”

Kokona
(concerned)
“Interesting? I’m sure it was fun, though, right?”

Haruki
“No, actually it wasn’t. At all.” 

Kokona
(sad)
“Oh, I’m sorry to hear that…would you like some of these?”

She extends one of her fragile hands. There is a small handful on konpeito in her palm. I take a few.

Haruki
“Thank you, Kokona-chan.”

Kokona
(happy)
“You’re welcome! Whenever I’m having a bad day, konpeito make me feel better. I like sweet things.”

Haruki
“Well, it’s fitting, for such a sweet person.”

Kokona
(blush)
“You really think so?”

Haruki
“Yeah.”

I put them in my mouth. They are sweet. When they’re finished, I yawn. I try to cover it with my hand, but it’s pretty obvious.



Kokona
(concerned)
“If you need to take a nap, I can cover for you!”

I laugh, but I shake my head.

Haruki
“That’s alright, Kokona-chan, I’ll be fine.” 

Kokona
(happy)
“Ok! You tell me if that changes, though.”

Haruki
“I promise I will!”

Kokona nods and pats my shoulder. Then we both go to the counter to begin work. The café is busy as always, but nothing particularly interesting happens. Nothing, that is, until she enters the café. That girl from the market. The one who was talking to the stuffed bunny. She still has the pentagram book under her arm as she walks up to me.

(Yuuki replaces Kokona on screen. Still referred to as ???) 

???
(shocked)
“You’re still alive!?”
Haruki
“Well…yeah…”

???
(shocked)
“But…I cursed you…I…I CURSED YOU! I, Yuuki Akuma, cursed you to bleed from the eyes until death! It’s a curse from this book, which is supposed to have totally, 100% real curses! What could have happened…? Did I pronounce it wrong…?”

She begins rapidly flipping through the pages of her book, trying to determine what went wrong. (Yuuki is now called Yuuki)

Haruki
“Pronunciation? More like the curses aren’t real and you don’t have magical powers.” 

Yuuki
(infuriated)
“EXCUSE YOU!?! No magic powers? No magic powers? I’ll show you! I’m going to curse you so hard that you won’t walk for a month!”

Haruki
“Well, to be fair, last time I was supposed to die. So I’m not actually that scared right now.”



Yuuki
(Creepy face. Super creepy)
“You should be…PREPARE TO SUFFER!”

She begins muttering under her breath, and I roll my eyes.

Haruki
“I feel fine. What a surprise.” 

Yuuki
(annoyed)
“It’s not done yet. Give me a second…”

I decide to play along. I scream aloud, drawing Kokona, Gumi-chan, Riku and Sora to my side. Customers stare. I feign writhing in pain. 

(Kokona on screen)

Kokona
(concerned)
“HARUKI-KUN!!! Are you ok?”

Yuuki
(creepy)
“Of course he’s not, I cursed him! Kukukuku…” 

Kokona
(concerned)
“Cursed him!? But…Yuuki-chan, none of your curses have ever worked in the past!”

Yuuki
(infuriated)
“Shut up! That’s not even true, I’ll curse you next!” 

Suddenly I straighten up. I laugh.

Haruki
“It’ll be hard to do that with your fake magical powers.”

She almost drops her book out of shock. Kokona, on the other hand, is infuriated and she slaps me. Hard.

SFX SLAP

Haruki
“What…was that for?”

Kokona
(mad)
“You made me think you were dying. I was worried.” 

I suddenly feel bad. I did not really think about that.

Haruki
“I’m sorry, Kokona-chan…”

Yuuki
(infuriated)
“Kokona-chan is the least of your worries! I-If you don’t start taking me seriously, I’m going to send my Kodama after you!”

I raise an eyebrow.

Haruki
“Little forest spirits? Is that supposed to be scary or something?” 

Yuuki mumbles something under her breath about how I wasn’t supposed to know what Kodama are. Kokona giggles.

Kokona
(happy)
“Kodama? The cute white spirits of the forest in Princess Mononoke? Could you send them after me? Please?”

Kokona keeps laughing, and I join her. Yuuki, on the other hand, looks murderous. 


Yuuki
(angry)
“Hey! You’re not supposed to beg me to send monsters after you! I’ll…I’ll send a demon to plague your house! A…A plague on both your houses!” 

I still cannot take her threats seriously. Neither can Kokona, so it would seem. 

Kokona
(happy)
“So, Yuuki-chan, did you want to order anything? Or just to curse the workers?” 

Yuuki finally closes her book and sighs.

Yuuki
(normal)
“Ummm, I want…uh, a bubble tea. And one of those cupcakes with a lot of frosting. One of the pink ones! …With sprinkles!” 

I cannot contain my laughter. Her order seems so ridiculous, for someone as demon and curse-crazy as her to want such frilly food. Nevertheless, she is served her bubble tea and frilly sprinkled cupcake and she departs to a nearby booth to eat it. 

(Yuuki off screen)

Not more than two minutes after Yuuki departs does the next customer approach the counter. Her hair is wet, as if she’s just been swimming, and her clothes seem to indicate that she is an athlete of some sort. 
(Ren Nanami on screen)

She walks up to the counter. 

Ren
(normal)
“Hi there! I don’t recognize you.”

Haruki
“Oh, uh, hi. I just moved here, so I haven’t met many people.”

Ren
(happy)
“Well that explains it, because pretty much everyone knows me!”

She extends her hand to me.

Ren
(happy)
“Ren Nanami! I’m a professional swimmer, by the way, that’s why my hair’s pretty much always wet.”

I shake her hand.

Haruki
“Haruki Nishihara!”
Ren releases my hand and flashes me a winning smile. Beside me, Kokona speaks up.

Kokona
(happy)
“Ren-chan pretty much lives at the sports center! She’s training all the time and she’s the best swimmer I’ve ever seen.”

Ren
(blush)
“Oh, shush. I’m not that good!”

Kokona
(happy)
“She’s just being modest, Haruki-kun! Ren-chan holds all the records in this town and there’ve been rumors that she’s headed to the next Olympics representing Japan!”

Haruki
“Really?”

Ren giggled and waved her hand.

Ren
(blush)
“No comment!” 

Kokona shook her head.

Kokona
(happy)
“Don’t listen to her, Haruki-kun! They don’t call her The Sailfish for nothing!”

Ren crossed her arms and pouted a little.

Ren
(pout)
“I get that sailfish are, like, the fastest fish in the world and all, but I’ve never really liked that nickname. Why not something pretty like a dolphin or cool like a shark?” 

Kokona and I laugh, and Ren eventually stops pouting and giggles along with us.

Ren
(normal)
“Alright, so can I order now?”

Kokona pulls out a pad of paper labeled Ren’s Orders. 

Haruki
“Why…?”

She waves off my question.
Kokona
(giggle/happy)
“You’ll see!”

Ren
(normal)
“Alright, so I want…um, ten sticks of dango. Three anpan. Five daifuku, ok? Three taiyaki. OH! And a big bag on konpeito. Like, don’t cheat me, ok? When I say a big bag I mean a big bag. And a bottle of ramune, surprise me with the flavor.” 

Haruki
“You’re ordering…all of that?”

I find myself at a loss for words. We had just been discussing her athleticism and now it felt more like we were talking to a 300 pound professional eater than a 100-something pound professional swimmer. Who ordered that much food!?

Ren
(normal or smirk?)
“Yeah, and?” 

Haruki
“It’s just sort of surprising…I mean, isn’t that kind of a lot of food? And a bit of an unhealthy diet for an Olympic athlete?”



Kokona
(happy)
“Olympic hopeful, I think you mean.”

Ren shakes her head. 

Ren
(smirk)
“A. I said nothing about being an Olympic athlete or hopeful. B. Do you have any idea how many calories a swimmer burns, Haruki?” 

I don’t.

Haruki
 “Well…no…”

Ren
(smirk)
“Well, it’s a lot! I’m starving pretty much all the time. Plus, I love food! Food and swimming, that’s pretty much it. And why should I deny myself half of what I love? The way I see it, if I’m doing all this exercise, I should be allowed to eat as unhealthily as I want!” 

She giggles, and I stare at her stunned. She actually made a pretty compelling point, even if her lifestyle did seem somewhat unsustainable. Kokona shows Ren the notepad and Ren flashes her a thumbs up. The order is correct. Together, Kokona and I gather the large order and deliver it to Ren. 

Ren
(happy)
“Thank you very much! See you around, ok, Haruki?” 

Haruki
“Yeah, ok!”

She smiles and waves, walking over to a booth near Yuuki’s.
